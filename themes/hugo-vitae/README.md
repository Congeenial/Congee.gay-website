# Vitae
... is a feature-rich yet minimalistic blog theme for Hugo that **focuses on your content**.


## History

After [Benedikt(aka dataCobra)](https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae) lost interest in further maintaining Vitae, I took over. I got permission from him to use the same branding. My main motivation for maintaining this theme is that I use it myself in my personal blogs, both English and Persian.
