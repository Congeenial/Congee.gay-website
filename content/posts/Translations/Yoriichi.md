> Tanjirou's mother, Kie, knew where the blue spider lily bloomed. Tanjirou had been shown it as a child, and he instantly remembered the blue spider lily in a flashback he saw when he was fighting against Rui. Because they do not bloom every year and the time they can be seen was extremely limited, Tanjirou was the only one to see the blue spider lily out of the six siblings. The place where the blue spider lily bloomed is the same place where Yorichi's wife "Uta" was buried several hundred years ago.
