##
`十二鬼月の最上位に立ち続ける剣豪。呼吸を極めており、顔と首に竈門隊士と似た炎のような痣を持つ、古くは鬼殺隊士。従属関係の破綻を危惧し、十二鬼月の序列を重んじていた。威厳に満ちた出で立ちは、柱さえ畏怖の念を抱くほどである。` 
> He is a swordsman who continues to stand at the highest level of the Twelve Upper Moons. He is a master of breathing and has a flaming birthmark on his face and neck similar to that of Demon Slayer Kamado, and was formerly a Demon Slayer. He was concerned about the collapse of the subordinate ranks and respected the hierarchy of the Twelve Upper Moons. His dignified appearance is such that even the pillars feared.
##
`危機に陥った際に体中から刃を突出。攻撃が激化した。頸を切り落とされても強烈な勝利と生への執着により一時消滅せず、鬼を超越しかけた。`
> Blades protruded from all over the body when under threat. The attack intensifies. Even when his neck was cut off, he did not disappear temporarily due to his intense fixation to victory and life, and he almost transcended being a demon.
##
`隠が調査した` 
> Hidden investigation
##
`無惨の視点` 
> Muzan’s perspective
##
`その強さも去ることながら油断せず相手を分析する姿勢は評価に値し、信頼は厚かったのではないだろうか。`
> In addition to his strength, he was also highly regarded for his willingness to analyze his opponents without letting his guard down, which leads us to believe that he was highly trusted.

##
`鬼となった経緯`
> How he became a demon
##
`双子の兄として育ち、侍の頂上を目指す`
> Growing up as the older of twin brothers, he aspired to become the best samurai
##
`当時不吉とされていた双子のうちの兄として生を受ける。格差をつけて育てられた弟の縁壱に類稀なる剣の才があることが発覚。己が欲することがあるものを持つ縁壱に、強い嫉妬と嫌悪を感じ始めた。`
> He was born as the older of twins, who were considered inauspicious at the time. He discovered that his younger brother, Yoriichi, who was raised with disparity, had exceptional talent with a sword. He begins to feel strong jealousy and dislike toward Yoriichi, who has something he desires.
##
`圧倒的な才覚を持つ弟を憎みながらも、剣の道を極め立派な侍になる夢は潰えなかった。`
> Although he hated his younger brother, who had overwhelming talent, his dream of mastering the way of the sword and becoming a great samurai was not destroyed.
##
`弟を超える力を求め、無惨を契りを交わす`
> Seeking power beyond that of his brother, he binds a contract with Muzan[^2]
[^2]: `契り` means pledge/vow/contract. This type of “favor and service” was common in feudalism, where the notion of loyalty was combined with service; in short, loyalty is service. Instead of it being simply an agreed upon clause both parties follow, the samurai was expected to be loyal to his lord and by extension, fulfilled the expectation that his contributions could be quantified (being Upper Moon One, eating humans to grow stronger). As such, it made sense that Muzan’s interest in turning Kokushibou into a demon, aside from the massive amount of blood it takes, would be the only person who he is ever contracted to. Possibly, this is why he considered Kokushibou a “business partner” as stated in the first fanbook. **Source:** [The Language and Contours of Familial Obligation in Fifteenth- and Sixteenth-Century Japan by David Spafford](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvr7fdd1.6?searchText=the)
##
`母親の逝去後、縁壱は消息不明となる。長閑な日々を送るものの、鬼に襲われた際縁壱の助けに入り、再会を果たす。縁壱の強さを追い、家族を捨て鬼狩りになるも痣の代償により余命わずかに。全てのしがらみからの解放を選び、人間を捨てた。`
> After his mother's death, Yoriichi disappears. He spends his days in peace, but when he is attacked by a demon, Yoriichi comes to the rescue and they are reunited. Chasing after Yoriichi’s strength, he abandons his family and becomes a Demon Slayer, but as compensation for his mark, he is given little time to live. He chose to free himself from all ties of obligation[^3] and renounced being a human.
[^3]: `しがらみ` shiragami means "ties"; the official manga uses "free of my fetters" which is also correct. I used "ties of obilgation" to make it sound more eloquent. 
##
`喜怒哀楽を感じず、人間の感情は夢幻` 
> Unexpected Descendants
##
`一目見ただけで、霞柱の自らの子孫であると把握。技量の高さや強い胆力を褒めたたえ、数百年の時を経た出会いに感嘆した。`
> At first glance, he grasped that the Mist pillar was a descendant of his. He praised the high level of skill and strong gallantry, and marveled at the encounter after several hundred years.
##
`人間の理を超越した憎き弟と再会を果たす`
> Reunited with his despised brother who transcended human logic
##
`赤い月の夜、鬼となった黒死牟は齢八十を過ぎた縁壱と再び邂逅する。理を超越した姿に憎悪が再燃するが、途中、縁壱が寿命で絶命する。最強の存在が消えた今、何者にも負けてはならないと勝利への執念は増大した。`
> On the night of the red moon, Kokushibou, who has become a demon, encounters the 80-year-old Yoriichi once again. His hatred is rekindled by the sight of the figure that transcends reason, but in the process, Yoriichi dies of natural causes. Now that the most powerful being is gone, his obsession for victory grows, and feels that he cannot be defeated by anyone.
##
`憎い相手にも関わらず、生涯で最も鮮明な記憶は縁壱のことであった。`
> In spite of his hateful opponent, his most vivid memory in his lifetime was of Yoriichi.
##
**The next Page after this is all of his abilities. I will not translate them, as the Demon Slayer Manga has most of them Listed.**
##
What I will translate though are the small tidbits of information listed in addition to his skills.

##
`百戦錬磨の武人の気迫 `
> The spirit of a warrior who has fought hundreds of battles
##
`会話の間合いが非常に長く丁寧に発声。黒死牟との会話は忍耐が必須だ。`
> Conversational pauses are very long and carefully vocalized. Patience is essential when conversing with Kokushibou.
##

## 
`最期`
> The End
##
`隊士たちの猛攻が驚異の再生能力を断つ `
> The onslaught of the Demon Slayers attacks cuts off his amazing regenerative abilities.
##
`隊士四名が決死の覚悟で頸を斬り落とすも、再生してしまう。しかし刀に映る自身の醜い姿を見て愕然と士、幼い頃に縁壱と交わした本来の望みを思い出すと、霞柱に刺された箇所から肉体の崩壊が始まり、消滅した。` 
> Even though four members of the team resolve to decapitate him, his neck regenerates. However, he was shocked to see his own disfigured appearance reflected in their katanas, and when he remembers the original wish he had exchanged with Yoriichi when he was a child, his body begins to disintegrate from the spot where he was stabbed by the Mist pillar, and he is extinguished.
##
`消滅後、幼い頃に縁壱に渡した木の笛が残る。最期までに心にあり続けたのは縁壱だった。`
> After his death, the wooden flute he gave to Yoriichi when he was a child remains. Yoriichi is the one who remained in his heart until the end of his life.

`無惨とは気が合うらしい。考えていることを全て読まれるので、基本的に鬼たちは無惨に怯えるが、腹の中を探られても黒死牟は気にならなかった。無惨を裏切るつもりは一切無かったし、むしろ、感情を隠して取り繕わなくてもいいからと気が楽になったとのこと。上弦の壱から動いたことは一度もなく、お気に入りの猗窩座に入れ替わりの血戦を申し込まれた時には嬉しかったようで、喰わずに生かしておいた(通常喰って吸収する。あくまで無惨の許可制)。入れ替わりの血戦を申し込まれたのは猗窩座を含めて数百年で三回のみ。使う刀は黒死牟の血と骨で出来ている。刀の名前は虚哭神去。`
> It seems that he and Muzan get along well. In general, the demons were frightened of Muzan because he could read everything they were thinking, but Kokushibou was not bothered by being probed. He had no intention of betraying Muzan at all, and in fact, he felt more comfortable because he did not have to hide or keep up appearances[^4]. He had never moved from the 1st of the Upper Moon, and was happy when his favorite Akaza challenged him in a blood battle to replace him, so he let him live without eating him (they usually eat and absorb the other. Only with Muzan's permission). He has only been asked to fight in a blood battle three times in several hundred years, including Akaza. The sword he uses is made with the blood and bones of the Kokushibou. The name of the sword is Kyokoku-Kamisari[^5].
[^4]: `繕` means to mend or repair. In the context here, it means he didn't have to disguise his feelings around Muzan. 
[^5]: Sword names were given to katanas who's legacy will be passed on or in legeneds where they would be used to cut down something. Generally, it's "name" would be the name of the blacksmith who forged it engraved on the base of the katana.  Whether this correlates to Kokushibou believing he will make a name for himself to be remembered by, I'll leave up to you. "Kyokoku-Kamisari" roughly translates to "Lonely Wail God's Death". **Source:** [Old Japanese Sword Names and Stories Relating to Swords](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43380044) and [Japanese Swords: Cultural Icons of a Nation: The History, Metallurgy and Iconography of the Samurai Sword](https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Swords-Cultural-Metallurgy-Iconography/dp/4805313315)
##
`挑発的な態度の猗窩座に成長を楽しみにする素振りも。彼の敗北を知った際は強がりを感じていた。`
> He even shows interest in the growth of Akaza who has a provocative attitude. He put on a brave[^6] face when he learned of his defeat.
[^6]: `強がり` is showing bravado to avoid showing weakness. I translated it as "brave", as best I could think of.

> Having six eyes, it doesn't confuse him. It might confuse others who see him though.
