##
**The translations go from left to right.**
## 
`十二鬼月`
> The 12 Upper Moons
##
`上弦の弐`
> 2nd Upper Moon
##
`童磨`
> Douma 
##
`無情に笑う氷塊の如き伝道師`[^1]
> A preacher who heartlessly laughs and is as cold as a block of ice. 
##
> [^1]: the term `伝道師` Dendo-shi used here is literally translated into evangelist. `As cold as` is added on by me to make the grammatical structure flow better. Translated without it would equate to "A preacher who is like a block of ice and laughs heartlessly."
##
`討伐証明記録`  Record of Subjugation/Defeat 
> `人間時の名前` Human Name ：`不明` Unknown 
>
> `身長` Height・`体重` Weight ：186cm, 86kg
>
> `趣味` Hobbies ：`酒風呂` Sake Bath || `酒が好きだったが鬼になり飲めなくなったので`  He loves alcohol but couldn't drink it anymore once he became a demon 
>
> `水煙管`[^2] Hookah Pipe || `煙草` Tobacco 
>
> `舞踊`[^3] Traditional Japanese Dance 
> [^2]: Here is a video on how a water based Hookah, Shisha, or Waterpipe works: [YT Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuznzG9X2kk)
> [^3]: The term `舞踊` Buyo in modern times translates to `dance`, but since we know Douma was born in pre-modern times, it's much more accurate to add `traditional` to indicate that. For more information on the contextual terms of `Buyo` and its dance forms, please refer to this Japan Corpus Wiki Article available in both Japanese and English: [Japanese Corpus Wiki](https://www.japanesewiki.com/culture/Japanese%20dance.html)

`柔らかな笑みを讃え、戦闘中でも穏やかに話す。真意では、人間は気の毒な存在だと哀れみ、見下している。人間を「救済」するため骨まで喰らい、特に栄養価の高い女性を好んで食した。指で己の脳をかき混ぜることで記憶を呼び起こすことが可能。` [^4]
> He puts on a soft smile and speaks calmly even in battle. In truth, he pities and looks down on humans as sorry beings. In order to "rescues" humans, he eats them down to the bone, especially women, who he favors for their high nutritional value. He can recall memories by stirring his brain with his fingers.
> [^4]: `救済` can be spelled two ways in hiragana: `きゅうさい` and `くさい`. The first is related to religious salvation in its generic form, though it could be a reference to Christianity. The second is a reference to Buddhism and achieving salvation based on his teachings. The Fanbook 2 uses the first spelling, `きゅうさい` so take that as you will.
##
`教祖を務める万世極楽教では、信者を喰らい、「救済」する。`
> In the Religious Paradise Faith, where he serves as guru, he eats his followers and "rescues" them.
##
`隠が調査した` 
> Hidden investigation
##
`無惨の視点` 
> Muzan’s perspective
##
`鬼舞辻に積極的に意思表示をするも、任務はあまり与えられていなかった様子。他の鬼にも少々煙たがられていたようだ。`
> Although he actively expressed his intentions to Kibutsuji, he did not seem to be given many missions. He seemed to be disliked by other demons as well.[^5]
[^5]: `少々煙` Translates to `A little bit smoky` in it's literal sense. I'm not sure if this is suppose to be a joke that maybe Douma smoked too much so they hated his company or it's a reference to a word I wouldn't hear in daily conversations. Another way to translate it would be he was `snubbed` by the other demons which means `rebuff, ignore, or spurn disdainfully`.

##
`鬼となった経緯`
> How he became a demon
##
`「万世極楽教」で神の子を演じる`
> "Acting as the Son of God" in the Eternal Paradise Faith
##
`極楽教を営む両親の元、瞳の中に虹が輝き、白橡の頭髪という稀有な容姿を持って生まれる。「神の声が聞こえる特別な子」と誉めそやされ、信者たちによって神格化。しかし、極楽浄土の存在は全く信じておらず神の声を聞いたこともなかったため、神や仏にすがる人間を愚かだと哀れみ、涙を流した。`
> Born to parents who practiced the Eternal Paradise Faith, he was born with rainbows in his eyes and a head of white-rubber hair, a rare appearance. He was praised as "a special child who can hear the voice of God," and was deified by his followers. However, he never believed in the existence of Amitabha's Pure Land[^6] and had never heard the voice of God, so he shed tears of pity for the foolishness of people who clung to Gods and Buddha.
[^6]:  `極楽浄土`  is a reference to `Amitabha's Pure Land` and his Paradise called `Sukhavati`. Read Here for a short description: [Met Museum Link](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/72419)
##
`幼少期から周囲の話にあわせて神の子として振る舞う。`
> From an early age, he acts as the Son of God in accordance with the stories of those around him.
##
`善行として人間を鳴い解放へと導く`
> He believes human cries are a good thing and leads them to liberation
##
`自身を優しく聡明であると確信しており、人間を救済することは使命だと信じて疑わなかった。血から肉まで残さず喰べることで共に永遠と生き、幸せへと導くことができると考えている。以前、伊之助の母である琴葉を教団で保護していたことがある。`
> He is convinced that he is kind and intelligent, and has never doubted his mission to save human beings. He believes that by eating every last drop of flesh and blood, he can lead them to eternal life and happiness together. He once protected[^7] Kotoha, Inosuke's mother, in his cult.
[^7]: `保護` Written here is not `守る` Mamoru, commonly spoke. Though `protect` in itself is the correct translation, understand that it in the context it is used, it more like to say Douma took **guardianship/custody** of her. But using `guardianship/custody` in itself would be incorrect, as that would insinuate an **adoption** of sorts, which was not Douma's intention.
##
`童磨の行為に気づいた琴葉は逃亡を図るが、伊之助を崖から逃した直後殺される。`
> Kotoha realizes what Douma has done and attempts to escape, but is killed shortly after she sends Inosuke over a cliff.
##
`喜怒哀楽を感じず、人間の感情は夢幻`
> Has no sense of joy, anger, sorrow, or pleasure. Human emotions are an illusion.
##
`人間の頃から感情がない。童磨の母親が色狂いの父親を殺害し、その後服毒自殺した際も悲しさや寂しさを感じず、血の匂いを換気することなどを考えていた。鬼となってからも、人間の感情が理解できなかった。`
> He has been emotionless since he was a human. When Douma's mother murdered his lustful father and later poisoned herself, he did not feel sadness or loneliness and thought about ventilating the smell of blood. Even after becoming a demon, he could not understand human emotions. 
##
`童磨に感情がないこと告げ栗花落隊士が挑発。冷静さを失うよう揺する。`
> Kanao provokes Douma by telling him that he has no feelings. She shakes him enough to lose his composure.

## 
`最期`
> The End
##
`蟲柱の毒で腐敗し、頸を斬り落とされる`
> Rotting from the poison from Shinobu, his neck is cut off. 
##
`致死量の七百倍の毒を体に仕込んでいた蟲柱を吸収。嘴平、栗花落隊士の足止めが功を奏し、骨から溶け腐る。大技で反撃するも、両名に止めを刺された。`
> He absorbed poison seven hundred times more lethal than the lethal dose that was planted in his body by Shinobu. The stalling by Inosuke and Kanao was successful and he melted and rotted from the bones. He fought back with great skill, but was defeated by both of them.
##
`死を目前にしても恐怖や悔しさはなく、人間らしい感情を覚えることはなかった。`
> Even in the face of death, there was no fear, no regret, no human emotion to be felt.

`二十歳の頃の無惨に出会い、鬼にしてもらう。無惨との出会位に感動しており、その後の万世極楽教の神は無惨となっている。忠誠心もあり、無惨のことを崇拝しているが、無惨からは好かれていない。無惨の経験では、強い執着や、渇望が無い者は鬼として大きな進化をしないと判断しているからだと思われる。それでも上弦の弐まで上がれるのだから、才覚は人一倍あった模様。`
> He is also loyal and worships Muzan, but he isn’t liked by Muzan. This is because, according to Muzan's experience, he believes that those who do not have strong attachment or craving do not evolve much as demons. Even so, it seems that he had more talent than the others since he was able to rise to the rank of 2 of the Upper Moons.
##
`信者から相談をされることもあり、金にせよ地位にせよ恋にせよ、欲望で身を持ち崩すさまはあまりにも馬鹿馬鹿士く見えたが、どういう感覚なのか興味を持っていたらしい。金も地位も半不死の肉体を持っていたが特に何も感じないので、相手を替えて度々子供の恋愛ごっこのようなことをしてみていた。`
> He was sometimes consulted by his followers about money, status and love, and despite the thought of getting carried away with desires seemed ridiculous, he was interested in what it felt like. Even though he had money, status, and a semi-immortal body, he felt nothing in particular, so he would often play childlike love games[^8] with different partners. 
[^8]: `恋愛ごっこ` In Japanese Psychology is called "Child-like Loveplay". To define it in it's simplest terms is `Loving someone for other reasons than love`. I.e you want to date someone because you're lonely, or you want to manipulate them, or you just love their appearance rather than anything about their personality.  `相手` Meaning `Partner` is a term with no affection behind it. It's just a way to refer to someone when you are both in the same situation. But, in this case, it is also a genderless term, so it could be mean Douma had no regard for Gender itself. Read here for more information `in Japanese`: [恋愛ごっこ](https://happymail.co.jp/happylife/love/pretend-to-love/). If one wanted it to be used in an intimate context, you would use something like `相棒` Aibo. It has mostly platonic connotations, can still mean romantic. Another case would be using `婚姻相手` Which means Marriage partner. 
## 
`上弦が招集された際は、鳴女を誘おうとするも言葉を遮るように断られた。`
> When the Upper Moons met, he tried to invite Nakime but was turned down, as if she was interrupting him from speaking further.
