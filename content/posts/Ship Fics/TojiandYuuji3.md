Toji lay on the couch with exhausted stoicism, drenching a blanket over his head and body while his legs rested on Yuuji’s thigh. He’s wearing a blue cotton sweater with black sweatpants, both bought by Yuuji since his usual attire was in the laundry. Yuuji was scrolling through his phone, eyes dithering to Toji and Megumi texting him his latest dinner plans. 

“Toji.” Yuuji tried to get his attention.

Toji grunts with eyes clamped shut. He thought he was fine in maintaining equanimity but as soon as he stood, his legs wobbled out of the tub. He would’ve fallen face flat had Yuuji not caught him. Talk about a delayed reaction. Simple imagery of what they did is enough for his stomach to clench and his muscles to tense. It was too fucking good and that’s what making him nauseous.

He knew this would happen and wouldn’t have shown these symptoms like he’s successfully done before, but Yuuji insisted he stayed.

Yuuji puts his phone down and massages Toji’s calves delicately. He pushes on the exacerbated nerves and attempts to release the tension built up. 

“Your body is really sensitive, huh?”

Toji didn’t respond. 

Yuuji’s not really surprised this would happen. He had some suspicion that it was due to Toji’s heavenly pact, though he hasn’t asked yet. Toji would’ve said he was right, but he’d be damned if he’s going to reveal it. 

For every benefit his heavenly pact had, there were a few downsides. 

Especially the sex part.

When the pleasure is focused on him, his heavenly pact elevates every sensation to the point where it becomes unbearable. Down from his tongue to his dick to his toes, it’s why he rarely lets others touch him for prolonged periods. A trail on his chest felt once pleasant turned to someone pouring lava on his skin. A whisper in his ear shifted to deafening peals of thunder. In battle, it was easy for adrenaline to suppress his nerves prickling at his skin, boring into his pores to get rid of whatever was afflicting him. 

With other people in bed, he disassociates. It makes it easier to deal with the sensitivity thereafter. It’s what he’s done when there's easy money to be made with his body. No cursed energy already ruined his life in the Zen’in clan; he wasn’t going to let a *heavenly* pact, ironic as it sounds, diminish where and how he chooses to pleasure himself. 

Somehow, he couldn’t do it with Yuuji. He’s tried several times, but the Kid does a good job of keeping Toji’s attention. Yuuji accepted Toji’s unique self-care as part of their irregular routine without much complaint. It’s not a frequent occurrence when they’re quick but longer sessions, especially with foreplay *and what Yuuji just did*, results in Toji lying here, on the couch, worn out. 

Yuuji wasn’t exactly *joyous* during the times Toji dealt with it alone when he found out. He let it go at first but now with their “contract” in place, he wanted Toji to stay. Yuuji didn’t know where he went, what he did to relieve himself, or what other person got to see him in this state.

He preferred helping him like providing a drink or ice packs. He preferred being the only person who could see him this way. 

For Toji, it was just one of the many, many reasons he never stayed long in one place. He didn’t like anyone seeing him like this, even Yuuji was no exception. 

Of course, Yuuji felt guilty. It tugged at his inquisitive nature to investigate to try and find a solution. He felt like he needed to treat him once they were done, every single time. He wants to alleviate the intensity of the aftereffects any way he could.

“Toji, what are you doing tomorrow?” Yuuji asks.

“Going to gamble,” Toji mutters through the blanket, “And pay a visit to someone.”

No specifications on either; Yuuji won’t pry. “When you get back, do you want to try baking together?”

“Sure, princess,” Toji peeps his head out, “What’re we making?” 

“Cookies.” Yuuji picks up his phone and angles it to show Toji the recipe, knowing Toji could read it from a long distance. He nods, resuming back into his cocoon blanket. He could feel Yuuji move his hand lower to knead his ankles and fell asleep.
___
The morning of, Toji wakes up and the fatigue has passed; he’s returned to his normal self and gets ready for the day. He’s a bit warm, eyes scanning another set of blankets that was draped over him. Toji’s back was to the couch pillows which probably meant Yuuji had squirmed his way into his arms to cuddle. 

He grabs his usual sweater and sweatpants combo from the drying machine. He loved that the machine was placed within Yuuji’s apartment. The laundromat didn’t let him nap like he could here.

He brushes his hair enough to settle down the weird pointy edges in the bathroom mirror. Sauntering to Yuuji’s closet, he shifts through hanging clothes to find his old tattered backpack on the back corner. He brought it over a few times to keep a change of garments; there’s the possibility he could get his cursed little worm to swallow them and bundle it with the rest of his weapons and potential dead bodies, but it’s not an endeavor he’s keen to explore. 

When Toji picks the backpack up, the strewn holes that used to be there are filled with embroidered patches of cute dinosaurs. The strap that hung on for its dear life by a thread is repaired too as if it’s brand new. Yuuji’s handiwork it seems. He opens his flip phone, wanting to text Yuuji “thanks” and attach a photo of his backpack, but stops momentarily when whispers crawl forth to remind him that he is undeserving. Unworthy. He ignores them and sends it anyway, slinging the backpack over his shoulder.

Breakfast was left on the table with saran wrap around the plate that had a sticky note reading “I’ll be back as early as I can! Hope you win a lot!” 

“Don’t jinx it.” Toji said aloud, tearing the saran wrap. Bacon, sausages and eggs, just how he likes them.

He finishes his meal and heads out.
___
On the subway train, Toji sits and leans his head back to the large window pane. People are in their usual cliques from businessmen to high school girls, but the train has enough space between the seats for Toji to keep his distance. There’s not much talking today—he usually can’t stand it in enclosed areas due to his heightened hearing—and the solaced air leaves plenty of spaces for his musings.

Evidently, he’s thinking about how he wants to place all of his shit inside of Yuuji’s apartment.

Not having a place to stay didn’t mean he didn’t have keepsakes stored somewhere. If he’s going to do this “job”, then he might as well keep some of his things there. Yuuji would’ve probably enjoyed seeing some resemblance of cleanliness when he organizes his shit. 

Yuuji’s apartment was pretty small, but it’s not like he had a lot to begin with to worry about space. Toji still thought about how tiny it was compared to when he lived with his clan and when he had a house with her. The Zen’in household was like a zig zag of corridors leading from one tatami room to the next. Wide verdanas that stretched on and on made every walk a journey when he was a child. His eyes would glisten with merriment at the gardens that bloomed colorful lilies in spring while on an adventure, sandals clicking innocently. When winter storms in and it is unforgiving like his elders, he becomes a victim to its beauty, clawing at shut lattice doors while encased in precious snowfall.

He remembers the room made for visitors; if he were to show himself there, his head would hang low. Obedient. It was a typical tatami mat room with an alcove; it had a scroll painting of spider lilies, a cursed weapon, and some old samurai helmets. There was a low-standing table in the middle, made from real bamboo with an assortment of treats he would hand out to guests. He did this willingly so he could paint the illusion he was a loyal follower, not knowing how brittle the Zen’in manacles were on him. It is only when he grew older that he held it like a normal human which felt strange. If one raises a human as a feral beast, then of course, it would feel like he was violating some kind of order. But at that point when much of his human side was shredded, he felt like a beast that neither needed to obey any human nor morals instilled on him. 

Then he sees the vivid bloody stairs, large straw rope dangling in the middle of a large metal gate. When it opens, it’s a vortex. It swallows him alongside the memories. He hears the score marks on the concrete floor, the scrawny whispers, the piles of flesh squelching with each step as if it was right next to him.

**Tired yet?—Let’s play again!—Hello, hello—Alive?—Boy, here—Small, big!—————**

Toji thinks of something else, *anywhere else.*

There was one room he liked; the training room. He spent his time dutifully swinging small weapons or his arms and would receive secret praise among his peers. Nothing else is detailed enough for him to recall, though. His attempt at recollection of how he organized his things at the Zen’ins was for naught. He just didn’t wanna keep it in his backpack and take it out when he needed it as much as he’d like to. Probably shouldn’t steal Yuuji’s hangers, too. When he lived with his wife, how did he keep his stuff there? Surely, he could pinpoint something. A habit. A certain tick.

Nothing came up. He clicks his tongue and deepens his already present frown. 
___
Yuuji hobbles and collapses on the grass. He turns to his side and groans. It was a training day in the open field within Jujutsu high; Megumi and Nobara were off in their own sparring session with Panda which left Yuuji to spar with Maki. Maybe he shouldn’t have asked or Megumi really downplayed just how brutal she was. The remnants of where she hit him felt like there were hundreds of wasps stings on his body. He tried to do the same and it didn’t work out well in his favor; he had greater strength, but lacked perception. Maki’s battle intuition predicted and deflected most of his blows.

He squeaked like a hamster when Maki smacked the middle of his back with playful cloud.

“Ouch!” He sat straight up, “Maki!” Yuuji tries to land a light-hearted punch. Maki side-steps for Yuuji to fall flat on his face, ass up. 

“Are you tuckered out already?” Maki said; she squats, elbows resting on her knees, “You’re the one who said you wanted to spar with me.” 

“We have been! For two hours!” Yuuji whines and rolls over. Maki smiles wryly, showing off her malicious delight from tossing Yuuji around like a stuffed doll. 

“Not long enough.” She counters. “I guess I could give you a break.”

“I’m sooo grateful.” Yuuji drawls. He weakly clutched his stomach and made a grouchy, but defeated face. Maki takes her seat not too far from him and undoes her ponytail. She gathers the bits of loose strands that’s stuck under the side of her glasses and loops them around her hair tie.

Yuuji goes back to his position of laying down. This would be a good time to question her about something that’s been on his mind. Maybe she could give some insight about Toji’s heavenly pact.

“Hey, Maki?” Yuuji asks. 

“Yeah?”

“You said you have little cursed energy and that’s because of a heavenly pact, right?”

Maki frowned. “What about it?”

“I have a friend,” Yuuji said, “He has one, too. A heavenly pact, I mean. He’s super strong like you, but sometimes he gets really tired easily.”

“What?” Ignoring Yuuji’s compliment, A heavenly pact meant for people with little to no cursed energy is gifted physical prowess; that doesn’t make sense. “Doesn’t everyone get tired? Is he faking it?”

“I don’t think he is…” Yuuji touches his chin; Toji’s good at putting on a farce, but Yuuji doesn’t think he’d do it to look weak. He should keep his explanation rated for all ages. “It’s not normal fatigue. He can’t really move. I slept next to him last night just to make sure he was alright.”

Maki scrubs the lens of her glasses; she furrows her brows. “Your *friend*?” 

“Yeah.”

“*Friend.*” She narrows her eyes; either they were exceptionally close friends or Yuuji didn’t know what dating meant. Even Maki knew the difference and she’s never had a crush. She thinks of who she knows with a heavenly pact and that was already far and few in-between; Mechamaru, the guy who controls those ugly puppet dolls was one. The other…she’s never met him. She’s heard his name in passing but they’ve never crossed paths.

“Mechamaru’s body is like that, isn’t it? He can’t go outside so maybe he's got a similar flaw.”

*She might be right.* Yuuji thought. *It’s not something I can help with.*

He suddenly felt like he was responsible for the times they’ve done it longer; it’s no wonder Toji preferred being quick rather than intimate, longer sessions. Yuuji closed his eyes and felt saggy weariness. What should he do? Is it something Toji can build a tolerance to? 

“Who is this ‘friend’ of yours? He in Jujutsu High?” Maki asked. 

“No…well, I don’t know. He doesn’t tell me much.” 

“A name, Yuuji.” Maki took the playful cloud’s staff end and pointed it to his nose. “Someone with a heavenly pact wouldn’t go unnoticed.”

Yuuji's worn smile and inability to produce one frustrates Maki. There’s one thing Toji made clear in the beginning of their relationship: he was a secret. No one important, like an invisible human that comes and goes and doesn't leave a trace behind. 

“Are you hiding someone?” Maki questions, “Like how stupid idiot hid you?”

“No, and he’s not someone dangerous either.” Yuuji replies. His voice changes its tune, shifting to an icy low growl. “Could you keep this between us?”

Maki knocks the chill out of him with a smack from playful cloud.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” She retorts playfully. Yuuji sighs. With no solution in sight, at least cooking makes Toji happy. He takes out his phone and starts typing out the ingredient list he needed for cookies. Flour, eggs, chocolate chips, some vanilla extract, and a message from Toji.

Yuuji sprung up and clutched his phone, put it closer and closer to his face, centimeters from his eyes, and then yanked it far away to double-check if he was seeing things. 

He opens the notification with anticipating fingers to see a photo of a blurry backpack, no doubt due to the low quality camera on Toji’s flip phone he refuses to upgrade.

‘Thanks,’ He reads. *Thanks*, Yuuji thought, *Thanks? He said thanks…*

Yuuji silently screams, rolling around in the grass, his phone close to his chest. He takes a screenshot and drags it to the album where he keeps photos of Toji and him.
___
Toji arrives in another part of Tokyo with a brisk pace to the storage units. 

The building is two stories high in pristine condition. When he enters, he is greeted by blinding white walls and a little robot on the kiosk screen waving at him. On the walls are pale gray doors lined up adjacent to one another. The reception area, which used to have an employee pounding away at their computer until they replaced all of them with kiosks, is what he walks towards with a tighter grip on the backpack strap. The kiosk is a tall white rectangular shape that had a digital screen with a smaller square space to spit out whatever the person needed. There’s a keypad below to enter his name and when he does(a fake name), the kiosk makes a long, exaggerated noise of approval, chucking a black key out of the square box. 

Toji scoops it up and moves to his unit. He rented the smallest one possible; a half-tatami mat room, equating to 0.8 square meters (8.7 square feet). He opens the door and melancholic nostalgia hits him. His eyes soften, reverting back to the expression he put on when his wife returned from the office. Most of what was in here was his wife’s. He took what was valuable not in cash, but in memorabilia. Her clothing, accessories, and other photos were kept sealed in a medium sized box. He hasn’t opened it since the day he stored it here. He used to mutter under his breath “Hey” like she was there. Sometimes, a part of him wished she would spring from the box and hug him. He’d take her and run away for good.

He didn't greet her, not today. There’s a sadness in not knowing how they lived together that he doesn’t want to apologize for. Toji came to grab his garments and nothing more. One extra pair of clothing wouldn’t hurt. He shoves it into his backpack, and a few more sweaters and sweatpants. Maybe more than one pair wouldn’t hurt either. 

Then he sees the small velvet box and flinches. It was the last thing he let go of. He touches it and lets it rest in his palm, opening to reveal his old wedding band. He used to roll it around his finger after finishing work and stored it here when he realized how dirty it had gotten. Toji moves his thumb around the ring, feeling the scars of his amateur polishing skills. 

He should bring it back. If he’s gonna retire, she needs to be a part of it. Toji puts the ring into his pocket.

He arranges back to the way how everything was originally put, minus what he took, and locks the door. On the side of the kiosk was a hatch opening where he dropped the keys.

As he leaves and prepares to catch the next train, his cellphone rings. Toji brings the flip phone to his ear.

“Yeah?” Toji said.

“Hi. Is it a bad time to call?” The person said on the other line.

“No.” Toji replied, “Did you need something?”

“I just wanted to hear from you.” 

Toji pursed his lips. The instantaneous wariness settles in and departs just as quick.

“Well, I’m here.” Toji remarks plainly, “But you usually don’t call me, Yuuji.” 

“I know! I have some free time right now.” Yuuji’s voice trails off, as if distracted, then he continues where he left off, “I think I want to go to a restaurant for our...uhm..” He whispers the word “*walk*”. 

Toji smirks at the hushed tone; he must be with his fellow Jujutsu sorcerers. “Sounds good to me.” 

“You can pick the place!”

“Anywhere?” 

“Yeah! As long as it’s not one you'll crash into later. Would be a shame if we wanted to eat there again.” Yuuji laughs, but there’s thinly veiled concern. 

“Spare me,” Toji tucks his hands into his sweatpants, continuing the walk back to the station, “It’s not like I got plans to take on new work.” 

“Oh.” Yuuji on the other line sounds relieved, and then he purrs into the phone, “I forgot.” 

“I’m hurt.” Toji sarcastically jabs, “You’ve forgotten about your *dear* dog already?” 

“Maybe I have. You should do something to get my attention!” 

Toji brings the phone’s microphone near his mouth. 

“Do you want me to bark again?” 

The line goes dead silent. For a few moments, he felt his flushed cheeks through the line and imagined Yuuji burying his face into one of his friend’s shoulders. He always makes the mistake of trying to tease Toji. 

“Let me win for once.” Yuuji hissed, hanging up abruptly. 

*As if* Toji thought, shoving the phone into his sweatpants. *You walk into your own trap, Kid.*

No one was around to notice his stupid shit faced grin. 
___
Yuuji arrives back at the apartment, leaving the ingredients for cookies on the kitchen counter and plops face first on the bed. Maki’s ruthless assault after their break was like a trial of how long he could last as a straw dummy; she hit him in every possible region *again* and made it a point that the next time they spar, he needs another set of backbones to get her to agree. 

*She’s good at breaking someone’s confidence.* He thought, changing to lie supine. *Just means I gotta get even stronger.*

That’s enough of Jujutsu High till the morrow.

He looked around the bedroom and saw Toji’s stuffed backpack; his sandals were gone so he’d probably be out till nightfall. 

He should change. He eyes the blue sweater Toji wore the night before splayed out on the bed. Yuuji drags it to his chest and curls his arm around it like it was a stuffed animal. He brings the collar of the sweater to his nose, breathing in the residual scent of Toji’s shampoo. What would he think if he saw him wearing his clothes? He unbuttons his uniform and takes off his hoodie as he imagines all of the ways Toji would call him cute, if he was honest. Slipping on the sweater, Yuuji laughs at how unrealistic that was. The sleeves are easily too long for him, loosely draping over his hand and ending around his fingertips. Yuuji tugs the sweater collar and smells it again, closing his eyes. 

He really wants to see him even though it’s scarcely been a day. Dragging his feet to put on black shorts that eclipsed underneath the sweater, Yuuji raises his arms and stretches.

*I’ll take a nap. He’ll wake me up if I sleep in.*

Yuuji gets snuggly underneath the blankets, sighing blissfully at the bed sucking him in. Tension slowly melts away, the aches from Maki beating him to a pulp dissipate into the sheets, and there’s even a weight on top of him, suction cupping the blanket.

Hold on, what?

Yuuji opens his eyes; there’s a creature with dark purple thick, puckered lips arranged around a round face. Its large bulging eyes are squinting at him with completely white pupils, crawling around his stomach and legs. A cursed spirit? *In his apartment?*

“Uh…” Yuuji gawks and sits up; the cursed spirit, who he sees now had a body like an overgrown caterpillar, turned his back to him then faced him again. The thin hairs on top of each connected round dark purple lump straightened like a surprised cat. The rest of its body contracted as its stubby little nubs crawled closer to his chest; Yuuji shuddered when one of its ”feet” sucked the fabrics of the sweater in to attach itself.

“**Mama.**” it gurgled with a shrill of delight at the end of its speech. Its mouth opened wide, jagged and crooked teeth showing. “**Mama.**”

“What are you…” Yuuji stopped short when the cursed spirit spit out a jitte-shaped blade with a circular cut at the end and a shark skinned wrapped handle. He sensed the cursed energy coming from it, exhibiting more than the worm had. Yuuji gulps. This is the same weapon he saw Toji use that was attached to the long chain.

Does…does this cursed spirit think he’s Toji? **Why does it even have Toji’s weapon?**
___
Toji blows out a puff of smoke; there’s a surfeit of emotions crashing and clashing blades that he’d like to keep hidden before he heads back to Yuuji’s apartment again. He came back once already to drop off his backpack and the warmth of it all made him queasy. His worm pet made noises of disapproval when he left it there, too. He didn’t feel like dealing with it getting hectic in his stomach when he smokes too many cigarettes. Gambling didn't do too much for his psyche either.

He shakes the cigarette pack in his hand to pop out another roll and puts it between his lips. 

“That’s three packs.” Mr. Shiu Kong said, leaning in to light it for Toji. They were outside of a convenience store, putting on a front of chatting casually. 

“Thanks.” Toji replies; he sucks in and a plume of smoke flies out of his mouth. 

Mr. Shiu Kong was more on edge than Toji. He didn’t know why Toji called him out there; for one, it wasn’t a business proposal and two, Toji looked like his wife had just died. They were lackluster eyes, sheening with regret and close to tears. But those tears were gone, as if it lost the concept of loss. They had made a lot of cash with Toji in this state before he settled to only taking jobs he felt like doing, but it’s not a place Mr. Shiu wants to return to. He was excellent to work with, but the amount of times he had to babysit Megumi and do his house chores like a wife was not worth even billions of yen.

“I have to go in five.” Mr. Shiu said. The employee at the convenience store counter was staring at them with suspicion, which was understandable. They’ve been here for an hour already without so much as entering. “You alright?”

“You using me to skip it if I say ‘no’?” Toji remarks; Mr. Shiu frowns, hitting Toji on the back of the head with a hard smack.

“Quit being an ass when I drove half of Tokyo to come see you.” 

The cigarette drops from Toji’s mouth and he grimaces. He steps on it and smears the paper roll and ashes. 

“Sorry.” 

“...Don’t be. Life going alright with that kid?”

“It’s fine.” 

Mr. Shiu sighs. “So? Why’d you call me here?” 

Toji takes a long, excruciating pause. He tries to compose himself with a clever answer, but there’s really none. He wanted company, a rare desire surfacing due to the gamut of his emotions ready to burst over from seeing one box of his wife’s.

“I can’t take on new work for a while so don’t offer me any.” Toji said.

Mr. Shiu raised an eyebrow. “Even if it pays well?”

Toji smiles. “Kid gave me a contract.”

Mr. Shiu whistles. “Must’ve been a fortune for you out of all people to agree. What’s the gig? Gotta kill someone?”

If only. That would’ve been easier to deal with. “Nah. It’s a retirement plan.” Toji leaves it at that and makes his way to the entrance of the convenience store. “...Thanks for coming.” 

Mr. Shiu laughs; what an odd phrase to hear coming from Toji, out of all people. An assassin rarely thanks the negotiator. He doesn’t believe it. “Pay for my damn cab next time, asshole.” He replies. Mr. Shiu departs once Toji heads inside of the convenience store.
___
What a sight to behold.

He had bought some ice cream for the two of them and came back to find Yuuji laying on his side, napping in his sweater. That’s adorable, he thinks, until he sees that Yuuji made his worm a body pillow. He’s resting his cheek on it and hugging it tightly as his worm squirmed its little nubs in protest. The lower part of its body was curling inwards, desperately (and unsuccessfully) wriggling for Yuuji to release it. 

“**Mama.**” it cried timorously at Toji, “**Mama…**”

He told the thing to stay hidden in Yuuji’s closet or cling to the balcony rails to keep out of sight. It’s intelligence surely can’t be that low that Yuuji wearing his sweater made the worm think that it was Toji. He shot a disappointing glare. Toji gently shakes Yuuji awake. 

“Kid, wake up.” Toji said. 

“Mmm?” Yuuji yawned, fluttering his eyes half open. He turns and searches for Toji’s hand, letting the cursed spirit go, which Toji gives. Yuuji curls his fingers around them, using it to prop himself upwards.

”Is it yours?” Yuuji murmured and pointed to the cursed spirit curled up and hiding its face like an armadillo. It is clearly traumatized from being squished as if it was a marshmallow in Yuuji’s hold, though Toji isn’t sure Yuuji could see that.

“Yeah…You mind telling me why you were holding it?” Toji asked. He should be glad Yuuji didn’t exorcise it; that could’ve been a disaster. Yuuji wipes the small tears from his eyes and scoots to let his legs dangle over the edge of the bed; he grabs the end of the worm and pulls it closer to him. Forcibly opening it and holding it on its back so Yuuji could rub its stomach, the worm made a clarion squelch of discontentment. 

“It’s cute!” He exclaimed, “I didn’t know you had a cursed spirit! It kind of reminds me of the protagonist in Earth Worm 4!”

“...Yeah…they kind of look alike.” Toji awkwardly replied, signaling for Yuuji to hand it over. Yuuji’s sad that he has to give it back. He gives the worm one more cheek rub (the cursed spirit did not appreciate it) and let's go. The worm coils around Toji’s chest and whimpers a relieved cry. 

“It spit out your weapon thinking I was you.” Yuuji reaches under the pillow he was napping on and pulls out the jitte-shaped blade. “The same one you used when we first met.”

Yuuji isn’t faking his interest, Toji could tell. “You aren’t gonna ask me why?”

“Why, what?” Yuuji blinked innocently.

“Why a person who doesn’t have cursed energy has a cursed spirit and weapon?” 

Yuuji shook his head. “I trust you. You’ll tell me one day.”

Toji doesn’t deserve blind trust. He doesn’t realize the clenched fist he had, anticipating embroilment. Yuuji didn’t inquire about it the first time he saw it either. It shouldn’t rankle him as much as it did, but shouldn’t it bother Yuuji that he doesn’t know? He’d probably never need to say that it was the Inverted Spear of Heaven and could dispel any cursed technique. He’d get away with murdering another Jujutsu Sorcerer and Yuuji would never force an answer out of him. All because he’s being considerate, has been since they met. 

How far can he keep that up before it begets Yuuji turning askance? There’s few reasons why he should keep it to himself if the amount of evidence was so damning and yet Yuuji doesn’t seem inclined on pursuing it. 

“What if I told you that it was called the ‘Inverted Spear of Heaven’ and could dispel any cursed technique, Kid?”

Yuuji’s eyes widened, stunned. He ran his fingers over the handle and tightened his hold. They were communicating!

“I would say that’s mega cool,” Yuuji said, glowing with appreciation, “And that I’d want to see a demonstration.” 

“I’ll do a live action,” Toji jests, “You can have front row seats.” 

He reaches for the blade and the worm swallows it back into its bottomless stomach. Yuuji watches the worm shrink into a tiny ball once Toji commanded it to. Toji was about to ask where the cookies were, but Yuuji wrapped his arms around Toji’s neck and pulled him down. 

“Will you tell me about the cursed spirit, too?” Yuuji said, “I want to know all your secrets.”

Toji’s eyes mellowed, chuckling to himself. He’s given himself a target on his back and it’s never felt better being caught. 

“Sure, babygirl.” Toji kisses Yuuji’s cheek, lifting him up, “I’ll let you in on a few.”

He carries him to the living room where they exchange more kisses until Yuuji cheerfully drags Toji to the kitchen.
___
In the kitchen, they measured and mixed together what was needed for chocolate chip cookies. Yuuji grabs a tray and sprays it with cooking oil; he then molded the dough into small flat circular shapes. Meanwhile, Toji washed the plates and bowls used for their prep. After Yuuji inserts the tray into the pre-heated oven, all that’s left to do is wait.

Toji thought they’d watch the television together on the couch till they heard the oven beep, but Yuuji sat in front of it instead. Weird, Toji thinks, though he joins him in his oven-guarding by sitting crossed legs next to him.

“So…your cursed spirit.” Yuuji began, “Does it keep more than that blade? How did you get it?”

“It can store whatever I want it to.” Toji replies, “I trained the guy when I lived with my…clan.” He tenses at the word “clan”. 

“And you can swallow it, and it stays invisible?” 

“It tastes like crap, but yeah. You can hide the cursed energy emanating from weapons, so my presence and weapons are both concealed.” 

Yuuji snaps his fingers. “That’s why I can never sense you! Because you don’t have any cursed energy!” 

“Mhm, Kid. Almost no one could.”

“Why didn’t I see it when I first saw you, Toji?”

“The guy I was hunting was dead before I even could, Kid.”

Yuuji wants to know more; he tests his luck by continuing forth with questions.

“Your job then…I mean, is it to kill cursed users?”

“Ah.” They were getting to the good part. “Curses, cursed users, *bad people*, whatever pays me the most.”

“What kind of bad people?”

“The ones who look down on others.” 

“...Jujutsu sorcerers?” 

“If it pays well.” 

He pays close attention to the dough expanding, cracks growing wider. The pieces of chocolate turn into brown gooey chunks as they melt into the dough. It’s not really important, but Toji found it the most monumental observation he could make. He didn’t want to sense any potential *animosity* or other emotions from Yuuji. Would he hate him? Would his impression of Toji be tied to the lives he took when it’s the only job he knew he could do?

Yuuji doesn’t bat an eye; the air stays light, feathery almost as he rests a hand on Toji’s shoulder. He turns him so he can see and Toji stares, *strained*. Maybe before they met, Yuji thinks, Toji was indeed a bad person. He could be still with his past barely known. 

But he’s never hurt him, not intentionally. If Toji was capable of that…then is it not possible for him to change?

“You haven’t killed one since you’ve started coming over more?” 

“Nah. it doesn’t pay enough.” Toji pretended to look bored, “It’s more fun to play pachinko.”

Yuuji leans into him. “Now you don’t have to.”

Toji pats his head. “Yeah. I’m obligated to protect a princess.”

“That’s not in the contract.” Yuuji blushes, lifting up the collar of the sweater to cover half of his face, “What’s with you?”

Toji shrugged. “It is now. You don’t want it?”

“I do!” Yuuji jumps forth at the prospect; that basically meant Toji was here to stay, right? “It’s nice of you. Thank you.” 

“I’m your responsibility.” Toji lifts Yuuji’s face with an index finger on his chin, “Honesty, was it?” 

It doesn’t hurt to give a little honesty and some trust. Maybe that’s what he needs. 

Yuuji nods, quietly capturing the spaces of Toji’s fingers. *I wonder what he'd say if I told him I’ve also killed someone,* he thinks, *Maybe it makes us similar in a way.*
___
The cookies were great; they were soft and chewy right out of the oven. Toji ate most of them in one sitting. His body could maintain endless amounts of calories and he could’ve eaten another tray of cookies if Yuuji was willing, but instead he’s on their bed, sloppily making out with him. 

He’s lying under Yuuji, legs hooked around his hips and hands on his biceps. Yuuji slithers his finger into Toji’s sweater, lightly touching his abs. With Toji’s tongue curled inside of Yuuji’s mouth, he moans excitedly. He was looking forward to being stripped…but Yuuji’s hand pulled back along with his mouth, looking down at Toji hesitantly. 

“What’s the matter?” Toji asked.

“...Does your sensitivity cause you pain?” Yuuji said, “Is there something I can do afterwards so it doesn’t hurt as much?”

Toji furrowed his eyebrows, displeased. “I’ll deal with it-”

“Please,” Yuuji pouted, “We’re not only friends now, Toji.”

“Kid…” Toji wouldn’t know what alleviates or suppresses the downsides of his heavenly pact; he’s never tried, only ever dealing with it once afflicted. “How about we forget about that? Figure it out later.”

“Is that fine? I mean—mmph?!” Yuuji is flipped over to be beneath Toji; his chin is gripped tightly, Toji exuding deadly intent. 

“Your dog is impatient. Are you gonna make it wait?” He growled.

It’s like a flip switch in Yuuji; Toji wasn’t telling him he couldn’t care but that either way, he’d be the one to pamper him afterwards. He should do as he liked and not worry. It’s what Toji wants, so how can Yuuji deny him? 

“...Sorry,” Yuuji grinned, “I’m not being a good owner.” He swats Toji’s hand away and grabs the collar of his sweater, yanking him closer. “I’ll make it up to you.”
___
Yuuji gripped the sides of the pillow he was laying his head on, trying to hide his smile. His eyes laden with silky amore dreamily glazes over Toji between his spreaded legs, suckling at his inner thigh. The black shorts aren’t off; they’re pushed up so Toji could have the room to nip and mark as he pleased.

It was Yuuji’s command to.

“Toji…right there…” Yuuji moaned, attempting to be still and soak in the tingle of sharp pain spreading throughout as Toji bit him. “That’s really good…” 

His erection bulging underneath the shorts twitches in joy, balls tightening as to not make a mess solely with his pre-come. Toji laps at the sickly salty skin, his tongue grazing over the indents of his teeth. He pulls away—and leaves a different one closer to Yuuji’s groin. 

This is different. 

Not marking someone’s thigh; he’s done that plenty. Being told sternly to pleasure someone was new. 

“Toji…come here.” He heard. He leans forward; Yuuji cups both of his cheeks. 

“Do I taste good?” Yuuji asked. He usually doesn't. Toji turns to kiss the lines of Yuuji’s palm. 

“Yeah, babygirl.” Toji replied. “You do.” It’s all Yuuji needs to lower Toji’s face near his bulge.

“I want you to suck it.” He demands, “Until I come in your mouth.”

“Someone’s needy today.” Toji comments, slipping Yuuji’s shorts and underwear off. “What’s gotten into you?”

“Didn’t I say it before? I-ah!” Yuuji mewls, back arching when lubricant is massaged around his dick, balls, and thighs. “I want you.”

“How badly do you want me, princess?” Toji muses. 

Such a tease. Yuuji thinks; Toji absolutely knows by Yuuji’s soaked underwear, yet he wants him to admit it aloud. 

“I’ll say it if you do well.” Yuuji smirks, biting on a nail. “So be a good boy and use that mouth of yours.” 

Toji scoffs and presses his thumb into one of the marks he left; Yuuji attempts to coil his legs as an instinctual reaction, but he’s held in place. 

“You’re not sucking.” Yuuji hisses. “You-”

Too late to say anything else, Yuuji’s eyes widened, caught off guard by Toji seating the entirety of Yuuji’s dick down his throat. The cold lubricant contrasts with the warmth of Toji’s mouth, coating his cock with saliva and the insatiable urge to thrust his hips. A breathless shudder, clutching on the sweater fabrics once his body’s sweltering heat traveled to his groin. He watches how Toji tactfully bobs his head and tongue drags across the bottom of his shaft, eyes closed like he didn’t need to know what Yuuji’s reactions were; he knew Yuuji couldn’t resist. 

Yuuji should’ve expected it. Toji even explained to him how he can regurgitate a cursed spirit and swallow it with ease; that should’ve been his first clue that his blowjobs would be immaculate. Everytime Toji pushes it to hit the back of his throat, the tip of Yuuji’s dick and the rest of him twitch involuntarily and Toji would chuckle, but he doesn’t want to ruin his superlative performance. He suckles on it a few more times before letting it go, an index finger tracing from base to tip. 

“You like that?” Toji licks his lips. Yuuji’s slit dribbles out even more pre-come; he covers his face in Toji’s sweater.

“Babygirl?” Toji insisted on a response, snatching Yuuji’s hand away and pulling the sweater from his face. He sees his expression; those cheeks are flushed with desire, but Yuuji never meant to be bashful. 

“I don't think you’re in any position to ask me that.” Yuuji leaned his head into the pillows, pretending to reach for his own dick as if unsatisfied. “It can’t be that good if I haven’t come yet…”

Yuuji giggles when that is what prompts Toji to bite his hand. When his performance doesn’t garner applause, Toji feels like he has to double down to prove just how good he could be. He’s about to go back down on him, a plan formulating in his head to overstimulate, but succumbs to Yuuji toppling him and sitting on his chest. His cock hovers near Toji’s mouth. 

“I guess I have to show you.” Yuuji threatens, grabbing a fistful of Toji’s hair and bringing his lips to the tip of his cock. “That you can’t stop till I come.”

Yuuji doesn’t force it inside; that’s not appealing. He wants Toji to open his mouth so he could slip it in again. Like he should know exactly what to do when Yuuji presents his dick to him. 

Toji likes this more than he should. He parts his lips and takes it down; this angle didn’t push Yuuji’s cock as deep as he’d like it to be, but it made it easier for Yuuji to move his hips. He thrusts slowly, that certain ache being satisfied by how Toji practically allows Yuuji to use his mouth like a fleshlight. Through the moans and mewls, Yuuji does eye Toji at certain intervals to make sure he was alright. 

Toji grips the side of Yuuji’s thighs, digging his nails in to almost break skin. It doesn’t hurt; he’s never had a gag reflex to begin with. It’s the frustration swelling inside of him just like the first time Yuuji had his way. The loss of control and autonomy at the behest of someone else; he hates this feeling, but he loves the way Yuuji looks down on him with absolute adoration. Those narrowed, washed out eyes and foolish grin might as well be Yuuji drunk on his lust. Yuuji groaned his name and desperately called out for him like he couldn’t satiate himself any other way.

He’s close to that edge, one final push down Toji’s mouth to release his seed inside. Holding Toji near his balls, Yuuji grunts loudly as semen pours down his throat. He shudders when he gently pulls out.

“Swallow it.” Yuuji said shakingly; his chest heaves while he takes in long, deep breaths to try and relax. Toji mirthfully smiled, gulping down the entirety of his load. He opens his mouth to prove there was nothing left. 

“Where’s my reward?” Toji purred, rubbing softly over the areas he dug his nails in. Yuuji takes a few more moments to recover, to find the words he’s always wanted to say. He soothingly runs his fingers over the place where he pulled Toji’s hair.

“I really like you.” Yuuji confessed with tender eyes, “You’re so pretty, Toji. I always want you by my side…” He wraps his pinkie finger around Toji’s. “I promise you’ll have me as long as you want me.”

Shit. Toji immediately flipped to his side and it knocked Yuuji off. Yuuji laughs, plummeting next to him with Toji reluctant to look him in the eye. And when he does, they’re so wrinkled that it emphasizes Toji’s crow’s feet. 

“Sorry.” Yuuji’s reaches for Toji’s face but stops; should he touch him when Toji’s sensitivity could flare up anytime? Toji made the decision for him by putting his palm to his cheek. *They’re warm like the sun*, the peach pink he usually saw graduates to amaranth red. 

“That’s cheating.” Toji brought Yuuji into his arms. 

“I don’t mind if my prize is you.” Yuuji pushes Toji’s bangs back and kisses his forehead. “Who said either of us play fair and square?”

A prize had to have some kind of worth, though. He’s always determined for that value to be zero, so anything else would always be more important than he could ever be. It didn’t matter how he felt, the reason, the *philistine of turmoil*. As long as he could place a value on something else like money, then he could use that as a placeholder for how to determine what was valuable to him. 

But Yuuji could see him in a way that he can’t; he doesn’t know what it is and he doesn’t want to ask. It means something to this Kid and that’s enough. 

“You want to go round two?” Toji asked, pointing to his own erection with his sweatpants still on. “I think I need another reward.”

Yuuji could melt hearing that. “Please.” He could go for ten.
___
Toji’s finger cradles Yuuji’s inner thigh, patting them both; they’re daubed with lubricant to ensure the little friction for what they were about to do. His now exposed erection bumps into the small space between Yuuji’s legs. He tests out how high or low he should be for the best experience, and decides on the mid-thighs. 

“Lift up your hips.” Toji said; once Yuuji does, he slips a pillow underneath to help with leverage. 

“Are you sure you don’t want a condom?” Yuuji asked. They rarely used them, but it should help with Toji’s sensitivity. 

“Should be fine.” Toji grunts, “Let me feel you raw.”

“Say please.” Yuuji emphasizes. Toji slapped Yuuji’s butt.

“Please.” Toji mimicked Yuuji’s tone mockingly. He crosses Yuuji’s legs and rests them on one side of his shoulders. 

Pushing his cock through the opening, Toji lets out a groan. Yuuji’s inner thighs were supple and soft despite his athletic build; the tip of Toji’s cock slid in and out easily. Yuuji growled under his breath at Toji, positioning his dick where he left his marks. He moaned in rhythm with Toji’s thrusts. 

“Don’t stop, Toji,” Yuuji whimpers with pleasant cries, “keep using me.”

Toji just doesn’t use his thighs; he ran his nails on the skin and left long red ribbon-like streaks. It pushed Yuuji’s nerves in all of the right places as it forced him to jolt and shut his eyes. The hot feeling of discomfort from the marks he’ll have to hide later gets even better when Toji’s cock continues its assault.

But he didn’t want to come yet. Toji halts and brings Yuuji to stand. He turned him so he could face his back and entangled both of his arms around Yuuji. 

“This is better.” Toji whispered, “Don’t you think so?” 

It was very hard for Yuuji to formulate a single, cohesive rebuttal as soon as Toji started thrusting again. He’s stuck in place with no option now to move his arms, knuckles white while he curls his hand into fists. He watches his cock bounce each time Toji goes in deeper, rougher, making the lubricant trickle down his legs.

“It feels good,” Yuuji said, “When you—?!?”

Yuuji leans forward, gasping a choked yell, swallowing it down as Toji bit his nape. He clenched his jaw and shivered, legs close to give out. Toji drew blood, lapping harshly. 

“I told you I’d do the same.” He said, “Except mine will last.”

“I want that.” Yuuji mustered from his soft, delicate moans, “Please, Toji. More…”

It makes him want to show off the claim; that’s what makes it exciting. He’d run his hands over his body tomorrow and touch the dints Toji left. They would throb to the beat of his whines and he’d fail at hiding the unruly face of pleasure. The grooves of Toji’s teeth leaped to Yuuji’s shoulders, the sharp collision of pain forcing another mewl. 

Toji’s final few thrusts and low growls made him come, spreading his semen around Yuuji’s thighs. 

He moves one hand to be on Yuuji’s stomach, keeping him standing. Yuuji turns to face him, their breaths uneven and unsynchronized. “Toji…” Yuuji pants; once he finds his feet again from the cloud nine he was floating on, he hugs him tightly. “Stay over tonight?” 

Toji steps back, falling onto the bed while Yuuji holds onto him. He stares at the ceiling, a hand reluctant to rest on Yuuji’s back. He moves it to russle the back of Yuuji’s head. 

“Alright.” Toji replied, sitting up and letting Yuuji cuddle him. Whether it was a command or not, he didn’t care. 

He wanted to stay, anyway.
___
Toji groaned, lurching into Yuuji’s arms. He rested his head on his chest and grumbled an entire chorus of swear words. It must be a bad flare up; this was the worst one of them all that he’s had. Is it because they went for two rounds? His head is pulsating like someone was slamming taiko drumsticks for the past hour on his brain. 

Water didn’t do shit, Ice packs were fucking useless, what the hell? 

“We should have used-ack!” Toji’s palm bunt Yuuji’s chin and forces it back, a sign for him to drop it.

“Are you really going to be okay?” Yuuji asked, eyeing the bucket of ice that was already empty. He can at least stroke Toji’s head while he lays on him.

“Let me sleep.” Toji retorts.

“...On me?” 

Toji shot him an annoyed look. “What else?”

“O…Okay!” Yuuji gave a determined face, “I’ll be the best pillow ever!”

Toji huffs, curling his body with his arms fastened around Yuuji’s waist. He grumpily puts a blanket over himself. This better not affect their date tomorrow or his mood will be as sour as the time they asked him to meet the next clan head of the Zen’in. 

Yuuji waits until Toji’s breaths are steady and the creases of his eyebrows disappear. He reaches for the phone that was on the night desk and browses places they should visit before sitting down at the restaurant. At times, he peers down and touches the side of Toji’s neck, admiring how free it was. 

Yeah. A collar would look good. A leash would compliment it. The color black would match with his hair. 

“Maybe a nametag, too.” Yuuji said.

Toji, fast asleep, didn’t hear a word.
___
“Toji, Toji…” Yuuji said; he gently rocked him. Toji’s body sways slightly with a loud groan, flipping over and tucking Yuuji close to him. 

“Five, more, minutes.” He replies, clipping each word. He doesn’t know what time it is and he’s ignoring the romantic drape of the sun’s cursed rays peering from the slightly open curtains. He just knows it’s too damn early.

“Our date is today,” Yuuji   shimmies his arms miraculously out to swirl his palms around Toji’s cheeks. Toji shakes his head and shoves Yuuji’s face deeper into his chest. 

“Today, tomorrow, let me sleep.” 

Yuuji is effectively silenced, muffling his complaint in Toji’s sweater. He sighs, shutting his eyes to comply with Toji’s morning grouch. They sleep for a few more hours before Toji sits up with a yawn, dragging Yuuji alongside him by an arm yank. 

“Are you awake now?” Yuuji kisses his neck, “We have to get ready.”

Toji groggily nods, letting Yuuji lead him to the bathroom.
