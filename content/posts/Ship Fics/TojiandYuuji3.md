Dom and Sub, shortened for Dominant and Submissive.

The terms were loosely defined as who commands and who obeys those commands. Anything else was at the sole discretion between two or more parties. Typically binded by contract, both non-sexual and sexual, the dominant and submissive had stipulations and expectations they had to fulfill. It was a consensual pact of mutual benefits where it could be broken at any time.

Toji tilted his head in curiosity, then chuckled. The kid really wanted to go all in with this “pet” shenanigan. 

He peers at the amount of pages this entire contract was and drags an exhale. Might as well get to it. 

It was a crazy leap jumping from friends to whatever the heck this was. He thought it was a funny joke, that once in a while he’ll call him a “dog” and he’d come with a tail between his legs. 

But Yuuji’s damn serious about it, so what had Toji gotten himself into?
___
No, no, Yuuji can’t tonight. He insists on having dinner at home no matter how tempting it was to join his friends. They were standing in the middle of Ginza after finishing a long, irksome mission of culling multiple cursed spirits that took the whole day.

Ginza, the side of Tokyo surrounded by upscale restaurants and the compaction of both small and large department stores. Megumi’s appalled by the amount of luxury brands shining at his face while Nobara’s ready to sink her wallet into the nearest shopping alley. Gojou being Gojou, was going to go along with whatever his cute students wanted.

He was diligent about his *omiyages*, after all.

Hearing Yuuji’s repeated decision to decline, out of all people whose naive curiosity froths at everything new, has Nobara feeling sad that she’s going to lose a willing pack mule. They’re going to be here for one night before parting their separate ways and she needed to take advantage of the nearest breathing entities with two arms to be her portable shopping carts.

“We just finished the most annoying mission ever and you wanna go back to your apartment?” Nobara pouted, “Fine.” 

She crosses her arms while Gojou consoles her by headpats. Yuuji slapped his hands together and prayed for some benevolence. He couldn’t call Toji the entire day and he didn’t get any texts either. Anxiety ridden by what Toji’s reaction would be to what Yuuji wrote on the laptop, he hastily needed to get back to the apartment. If Toji was even there, that is, and Yuuji desperately wished he was. 

“Leave it be. It’s probably…” Megumi’s smile was like a crescent moon. “Your friend, right?”

“Friend?” Gojou feigns a surprised gasp, “You have someone staying over?”

They all knew. As much as Yuuji tried to conceal any resemblance of them, his habits had clearly changed. Going home earlier, checking his phone constantly, he had all the signs of someone who had found someone important.

He vehemently denies claims (for Toji’s sake) to no end, but no matter how much Yuuji says it’s “normal”, no “normal” friends leave marks on each other.

“Something like that. We’re really friends.” Yuuji repeated, already running with his eyes, “I’ll see you later!” 

He dashes towards the station, waving behind him and promising he’ll text Nobara tomorrow morning. 

“They’re not friends, are they?” Gojou plopped his chin onto Megumi’s head, immediately regretting that decision upon feeling a thousand needles.

“Who cares,” Nobara raises her hammer, “Let’s go eat some yakitori! And buy more souvenirs!” 

“Actually, I’m—?!?” Megumi’s last words came out as croaks. Nobara had put him into a locking chokehold, dragging him along.
___
*Tap, tap, tap, tap, click!*

Yuuji rushed inside of his apartment, hopping on one foot while the other kicked his shoe off. 

“Toji?” Yuuji calls out and silence answers him. A quick glance at the *genkan* noted that Toji’s sandals were gone. The living room is empty with barely any signs that Toji had stayed except for the couch blankets which were sloppily folded; an intentional signature of his since Yuuji’s first complaint about it. Dark clouds surrounded his vision with a sudden feeling of regret. 

“Welcome back, babygirl.” 

That sound of throaty growl at the end of his sentence, he turns around to see Toji holding a small plastic bag and a six pack of Yuuji’s favorite brand of soda. 

“Hi! You went out?” Yuuji walked behind him as Toji set down both items on the dinner table. 

“Uh huh. Dinner.” Toji took out two boat-shaped containers of hot takoyaki with fish flakes still dancing atop. To Yuuji’s delight, there was a side of ginger in Toji’s container. 

It makes Yuuji’s guilt even worse for assuming he was gone.

“Th…thanks.” Yuuji cursed under his breath. 

Yuuji grabs a seat and eats quietly with a downcasted gaze, and that bothers Toji. Not the eating part, but usually he’d blabber about what he did or the mission he took on. Did he do something? Toji scratched the back of his neck; the annoying itch of wanting to ask what’s the matter won’t go away. He’s not going to, because *it's not his business and if the brat really wanted to say something, he would,* but he’d hoped for more enthusiasm.

“I read it.” Toji settles with saying that, hoping that’s enough to mollify. Yuuji drops his chopsticks with his mouth agape. The takoyaki currently on his tongue is swallowed in desperation, only for it to go down too fast and get lodged in his throat.

“R-reall-” Yuuji choked and emptied his soda to try and soothe the pain, “Was there a-any-ack-” 

Toji sputtered a quaint quiet laugh; an exultant tune that sounded unbecoming of him. It surprised even himself. Whatever the kid was brooding about was gone, just like that.

“Pfft.” Toji popped another can open for him, “Finish your damn food first.”
___
After dinner, they had decided the best way to talk about the contract was on the bed.

Yuuji tucked his legs further into his body. They were sitting side by side. The matcha tea in his hand that had bristles of steam fluttering about is a comforting distraction while he meets Toji’s eyes. 

“So…do you want to change anything?” Yuuji takes a sip, “Was there…anything you disliked?”

This is the first time they’ve ever had a lengthy discussion about anything and he would like to not mess it up. Toji’s seemingly cross gaze at the document made the matcha tea be subjected to earthquakes by way of Yuuji’s shaky hand. He should’ve known better as Toji avoided answering and asked his own questions. 

“When and why did you write this?” He asks. He’s confident Yuuji didn’t know squat about “Dominance” and “Submission”, but rather used it as a way to allocate his desires into a contract that was logical and plausible for Toji to accept.

“I didn’t write it.” Yuuji confessed, “I found one on the web and changed a few things.” There’s a pause; Yuuji curled his toes into the bed sheets. “...I thought it might be easier if you had something in print. That way, if you ever disliked me or what I was doing…”

Toji wouldn’t need “emotions” as a reason for leaving. “Annoyance” and “being a burden” didn’t need to exist, but instead was a breach of contract, one that he could point to and then shred in half. It could be considered a job for him, which was more enticing than entering into a dynamic purely for romance. 

An easy ass job, for sure.

The contract listed Toji as the submissive and denoted certain “rules” he’d adhere to; not taking any “work” that could be an endangerment to his life (which was almost all of his work), staying home when asked to, and going out with Yuuji once a week to anywhere he wanted (he wrote it in the contract as “walks”). There’s a bunch of other things listed there, but nothing that deviated from Toji’s preferences.

He supposes this is what Yuuji meant by being a “dog”.

(Toji would’ve considered the rest of the contract jargon and lied that he read it. But since he had considered this a job, he had to make sure there weren't any strange loopholes he was roping himself into.)

Yuuji, the dominant, was to provide a place to stay and whatever else Toji asked for such as money, food, and more. In return, he gets to command Toji based on the allowable and what was written, like “walks”. This was hardly a difference from what they were already doing, save for it being under contractual service and the “walks”, which were just dates. Okay, the dominant part was new actually, so was Yuuji taking the lead being defined as “commands”, but they’ve never established any strict dynamic and to be frank, Toji can’t imagine Yuji being dominant. 

He can’t see himself submissive either, but that didn’t really matter. Yuuji was offering an unlimited amount of cash and money talks. He shouldn’t worry about logistics, not yet.

So, Toji had basically all to gain, and nothing to lose. He gets companionship without the nuance of love, and Yuuji gets someone who is situationally loyal until the contract breaks. 

“You know, I thought you were going to force me to wear some ears.” Toji said, and Yuuji leaped like a kangaroo. 

“I said I wasn’t into that!” Yuuji attempts to push Toji on his biceps and Toji’s laconic, choosing to stare with a neutral face like the immovable wall he is. He watches him play with the bits of his sweater fabric before speaking.


“I don’t want to force you to do anything. If there’s something you hate, can you tell me? If you don’t like it, we can drop it. I just wanted to try.”

There was nothing to hate. “Hate” is a strong word, perfectly suited for his clan, for him too, but not for Yuuji. 

As long as it benefited him, which a lot of it did. If Yuuji’s fine with him. It sounded like a once in a lifetime deal, and an early retirement at that. Like he said, he’s not one to dwell on *why* he feels a certain way. He’s not going to bother wondering *why* he shouldn’t take it.

Although…He does admit it feels different than selling himself for the usual “work”. Then again, he’s been offered to do stranger shit.

He types his name in under the last page requesting signature and turns the laptop so Yuuji could do the same.

“This answers your question, Kid.” Toji says.

“You want nothing changed? Okay, Uh. Uhm-” Yuuji fights the hug creeping in to take control of his body. He didn’t prepare for this. He’s over the moon, not looking a gift horse in the mouth, and other abundant idioms. He’s so excited that he mistypes his name. 

“You wanna try it now?” Toji asks; Yuuji almost flips the laptop over from shock.

“Yes?” Yuuji replies, “Wait, you mean in bed?”

He’s so unsure if Toji’s testing him. Toji never asks for it and Yuuji wants to crumple like a sheet of paper so that he could hide the transfixation on his face when Toji smirks.
___
*He agreed!* Yuuji thought, rolling around while keeping a pillow tightly bound to his chest, *He said yes! I haven’t felt like this since I found out I was training with Gojou-sensei!*

He muffles a scream into the pillow, sitting upright with his back erect when a daunting realization seeps into his rosy cheeks.

*Yuuji had no idea what it means to be dominant.*

He’s said a few things here and there, some thoughts scattered about, but he’s never taken on a role of being a dominant.

He doesn’t have time to swipe and skim through generic sites to at least read up on what to do or how to behave; Toji’s already out of the shower. The towel that’s wrapped around his waist seems to be coming loose (so is Yuuji’s sanity) as he sits on the edge of the bed next to him. The scent of shampoo, bourbon and oak, hits his nostrils while Toji dries his hair.

Has it always been this nerve wracking? Has Toji ever looked so damn attractive with the tips of his hair glistening with shower droplets, his skin brand new and unclaimed, his eyes fluttering their delicate lashes? Yuuji’s one hundred percent sure he didn’t have these features be so well defined before the shower, so he must be experiencing delusional jubilance.

“So?” Toji says, and it startles Yuuji enough for him to jerk his head to the floor. “We gonna start?”

Toji raises an eyebrow and leans in, an arm tenaciously wrapped around Yuuji’s back. “Or do you want more time?” 

Breathe, don’t mess this up. Don’t look stupid. He’s more experienced than me, but! Yuuji thought; he warms his cheeks with his hands, taking in one long breath. I can do this.

Yuuji glances one more time over Toji, clutching his own chest. If he is to show him how much he wants it, he needs to court not just Toji, but the monsters he carries with him. 

“Hug me.” Yuuji says, “I want to hold you.”

“...You’re kidding.” Toji replies. “Kid-”

“You’re a dog right now.” Yuuji opens his arms, “So hug me.”

Toji’s groans, “I’m naked, and you want a fucking hug?”

“...Yeah.” Yuuji deflates his arms, but raises them again, “It’s not a suggestion.”

“Ugh…”

Toji covers his face with his palm, shaking his head. 

Yeah, yeah…It’s an order. I got it, Kid. Toji thought. He begrudgingly sees Yuuji’s eyes instantaneously unravel with childish enthusiasm when Toji pulls him closer. 

Large biceps encircle around Yuuji lacking any strength. His hands lurk and eventually settles to one on Yuuji’s lats, and the other around his nape. Yuuji giggles, tucking his head into Toji’s shoulder blades. 

“What are you laughing about?” Toji mutters. How long did he want this hug to last?

“I’m happy, that’s all.” Yuuji comments; he nudges Toji’s head so his forehead presses onto Yuuji’s shoulders. Toji’s eyes widened, ready to pull away; *these actions were his limits.* Or so he thought they were, until he felt Yuuji’s hand stroke his hair. 

It’s an invasive rush of heat, one that he must endure. He deplores acts of affection *for the sake of affection* ever since she died, and even if this was a “command”, he should’ve shoved him away. But Yuuji’s hand carding through his moist hair didn’t feel awful. Toji feels the tips of Yuuji’s finger rub his scalp, scratching it with endearing reverie. 

“I’ve,” Yuuji clears his throat, waiting a second, “always wanted to hold you.”

You’ve held me plenty. Toji thought, but he can’t make out the words to admonish or tease or refuse.

What is a minute in the real world feels like an hour. Toji’s fingers tug and maneuver even lower, pulling Yuuji tighter to him. There is—admittedly tension—, rippling through his arms to still tear away. She was small and he protected her, and Yuuji’s larger form, not as big as he is, but enough to cradle him, mirrors what he would do to her. He doesn’t want to remember her.

No…maybe that isn’t it. 

He just didn’t want anyone to replace her.

Then Yuuji lets go, and Toji must relinquish the want of comfort that was waning and waxing the contours of his body.

Toji sees Yuuji open and squeeze his own palms with a lopsided grin. Yuuji nods, then shares his palm with splayed fingers to Toji as if a bewitching spell was on the creases.

“How did that feel?” Yuuji joyfully asks. 

“What else did you want?” Toji once again avoided answering him. Avoidance was about as good as acceptance when it came to Yuuji, and Yuuji latches his fingers to Toji’s palm. 

“Undress me.” Yuuji commands.

A harmless act that was a part of everyone’s daily routine, yet forms new meaning when someone else’s hand is taking action. Toji’s frown turns to a smile that has the weight of blood, full of vitality. He unsnaps the buttons to Yuuji’s uniform and slowly slips off the sleeves. The hoodie falls off of his head and onto the ground. Yuuji instructs Toji to lay on his bed with his back resting to the headboard of the bedframe and crawls to him, sitting between Toji’s legs.

Toji’s reaction was to do the usual; rest his hand on Yuuji’s waist while he had his way. Yuuji prevents him by grabbing his wrist, ramming it back down to the bed.

“Not today,” Yuuji says with a sultry whisper, “I tell you where your hands go.”

Toji belligerently glares and bares his fangs, but concedes after contesting with Yuuji’s equally intense milky brown eyes. Yuuji directs Toji’s hand to touch his chin then down to his neck. It slithers to his clavicle and stops at his chest, right where his heart would be.

“Keep your hand here.” Yuuji says, trusting Toji. He releases his hold and intrudes closer on all fours, further, to meet his lips. 

Soft kisses exchanged unspoken words; Toji could feel each thrum of Yuuji’s heart, so much so that it was ready to burst out of his ribcage. It intensifies when they graze each other’s tongues, lapping at their temporary devotion. Each string of saliva makes Yuuji’s heart palpitate; every moan echoes in his chamber full of affection, drumming for the person in front of him. 

“Toji…” Yuuji moans, slinking his body down; his face nudges into Toji’s shoulders once they are finished. 

“Mmm…?” Toji hums. He felt good. Whatever this was, *was good*. Dithered eyes eventually stare at Yuuji, breathing a long sigh. There’s something irresistible about what Yuuji just did. Hearing another's heartbeat is like an orchestral performance, each valve pulsating, contracting and releasing, arranged in an erratic yet harmonious symphony, and he couldn’t help but be in awe. 

He hears it every time he takes a life, but never for it to *breathe life into him.*

“Let me touch you…” Yuuji mumbles with a face of narcotic languor from kissing alone, his words dancing across each syllable. 

He unwinds Toji’s slipping towel and peeks at his half erection. Toji bites back a groan when cold lubricant is lathered on his cock; his eyes narrow at Yuuji and digs his nails into Yuuji’s forearm. Whatever sensation before felt like too much of a dream, and he’s brought back to harsh reality. It’s an instinctual grab, one made from uneasiness that someone else touched him in a vulnerable state. It is not like Yuuji either to take without permission, especially from Toji, who he knew has a strict disposition towards the matter.

Yuuji, of course, attempted to recoil under the assumption that Toji disliked it. He’s feeling what is a fraction of Toji’s real strength on his forearm, but that alone is enough to root him. So Yuuji reaches for Toji’s neck with his other hand. It’s to entangle his fingers around his throat, neatly arranged under his chin. 

“What are you still showing your claws for?” Yuuji demands, meeting defiant eyes, “Aren’t you going to let me make you feel good? *Please?”*

A pause, then Yuuji snakes his hand down to Toji’s hips. He anticipates Toji’s reaction, and Toji rips Yuuji’s arm away to raise it high in the air. His other hand hooks behind Yuuji’s head, pulling his hair.

A predator versus his hunter. They get close as to tearing the flesh from skin, to devour each other by their voracious appetites.

But Toji succumbs; he always has, whether he knows it or not, upon seeing Yuuji’s soft gaze. They tell him that he would truly cease if all of this was too much. 

“You better make it worth my while, brat.” Toji hisses. 

“I will.” Yuuji replies exasperatingly desperate, edging him with a grin, “Because I want you.”

It’s enough for Toji to let go; he relaxes, leaning back further to allow Yuuji the space he needs. Yuuji kisses the bridge of his nose, and turns his attention to where it really needs to be. His hand feels the warmth of Toji’s member again, watching it with glee when it becomes fully hard. He starts pumping in slow thrusts, mouth capturing Toji’s shoulders and chest.

Toji shudders, shakingly gasps, and moans loudly. The head of his dick gets the brute of Yuuji’s thumb circling the tip, a feeling he doesn’t enjoy doing to himself, but it almost forces him to raise his hips when it is Yuuji's hand. A ball of frustration that he submits, tangled with the strange affinity that he likes it. Yuuji’s other hand sits at the side of his hips, delicately fondling defined muscles. 

“Fuck,” Toji half-whines, the other thing he wanted to say lost in growls, “Yuu-”

A jolt of pain sent him reeling; Yuuji had sunk his teeth to the side of his neck. Toji grunts, pulling Yuuji up by a fistful of his hair to lock their lips. Roughly colliding tongues, he masks his pleas while Yuuji practically purrs from the harsh treatment. 

“To, mmph, ji,” Yuuji laps at Toji’s bottom lip, “I want to hear you…” 

Nothing but Toji’s yearning expression, cheeks flushed with vermilion, telling him that it was alright. The feeling in his uniform pants tighten, hypnotically locked onto that face. Who else can bear witness to this beautiful, rustled form? The strands of his hair drowning out his narrowed eyes, furrowed brow while he watches Yuuji brush his hand around his shaft, wanting to touch, to control how he wants to be pleased.

His hand increases the pace with every pump on his cock sending him closer to release. Toji can’t control his arms going around Yuuji's neck and leaning his head into him, soft breaths near his ears. His feet push into the bedsheets once heat quickens its accumulation around his crotch. 

“I’m gonna come,” He says breathlessly; Yuuji mewls, complying and focuses his hand thrusts to the head of his penis. 

“Good boy,” Yuuji says excitedly, “Let it all out.” 

A burst of spurting semen shoots from the slit of his cock and hits Yuuji’s abs. Toji’s body quivers, taut arms keeping themselves latched around Yuuji’s neck to steady his breaths. When he comes around, Yuuji carefully sits Toji up, one hand behind his back to support him. 

“I’ll get you some water.” Yuuji says. Toji slumps down to rest on the pillows. 

*Fuck* Toji thought. He grabs another pillow and slams to his face. *Damn it.* 

That felt really, fucking good. Better than usual. He barely touched the surface of the place Yuuji bit him and flinched.

*Well, well.* Toji could almost laugh once he picked up a metallic scent. Yuuji really bit him so hard that he bled? *That’s a first.*
___
*Oh my god.* He thought. *What did I just do?*

Yuuji’s knees wobble and he sinks to the floor once he closes the bedroom door behind them.  He looks down at his pants which were wet around his groin; unclasping his uniform belt, Yuuji stretches it out just enough to see his cock flaccid with come messily spread on his boxers. 

*I came from hearing him come…*

Yuuji winces, covering his eyes and he snaps his uniform pants back into place. He had gotten so excited, so enticed by Toji moaning in his ear, submitting, letting him be touched so freely-

“I’m gonna get hard again!” Yuuji walks in big strides with overdramatic flailing arms to the fridge. He grabs two water bottles and wraps an ice pack in a small hand towel. He must chant a mantra to himself while he walks back to the bedroom and stands over Toji.

*Think with my mind, not my hormones. Think with my damn mind, not my hormones. Please just think with my HEAD and NOT my hormones!*

“Here.” Yuuji offers a bottle.

Toji snatches it from his grasp. He glugged the whole thing down in seconds, taking the ice pack as well and touching it to his stomach. 

“Should we take a bath?” Yuuji asks, and Toji glances at their mess of sweaty bedsheets.

“You first.” Toji heaves, “Shout when you’re done.”

“I mean…together?” 

“Does the bath fit two?”

“We can make it fit.”

“I don’t wanna move yet, Kid.” 

Maybe another hour, and he’ll get up and lazily clean himself off. 

“I can carry you.”

Toji glares at that suggestion; Yuuji sheepishly takes a step back. “If you want to,” He explains, “I’d like to wash you, too.”

“...Are you asking me that?” Toji sighs, “Or ‘commanding’ me to?”

“Asking you,” Yuuji holds out his hand, “I don’t want to do things to you that you wouldn’t like.”

“I’m not a princess.” Toji sits up anyway.

“No, definitely not,” Yuuji chides, “That’s my role, isn’t it?”

This fuckin’ kid. 

Toji grabs his hand and stands. Yuuji bends down, arms behind Toji’s knees, the other on his back. He lifts him up, walking to the bathing room and puts him down in the tub. The feeling of cold porcelain is forgotten once Yuuji fills it with warm water. Toji cocks his head once he sees Yuuji’s obvious damp areas on his uniform pants. 

“When did you come?” Toji asks smugly, “That's impressive, doing that hands free.”

“Oh…” Yuuji opens his mouth to say something, closes it, then looks away. He tentatively glances at Toji, which now became a hundred times harder to do, “When I heard you…”

“I see.” Toji flicks a bit of water at Yuuji’s face, “That’s a talent.”

“Shut up,” Yuuji pouts. He takes off his pants and boxers, gets into the tub and sits on the opposite side of Toji. A few minutes of unwinding the high of pleasure, Yuuji then takes the bottle of shampoo and a sponge pouf. 

“Is it fine if I start now?” Yuuji asks again to be sure. 

“Go ahead.”

It wasn’t customary to clean oneself in the bathtub, but neither of them found reason to complain. Yuuji raises Toji’s arms and scrubs him while Toji quietly watches. 

The last time he was cleaned by someone else was when he was a child. Perhaps his mother who he can’t remember the face of, or his father who he forgot too, washed the blood off his face after he was beaten. He had cried, and begged every time; he was cleaned so often because he was filthy. Towel over eyes, gauze around his forehead, wrists, legs, each part of his body subjected to berates of the upper echelons of people who found his existence unbearable. He had cried because of fear and he in return, smashed that fear into a billion pieces so it could never hurt him again. 

That fear, boiling inside of him as Yuuji moves the sponge over each hair on his arm, simmers when he knows he is safe. He will not hurt him, and Toji closes his eyes. 

What inanity, reminiscing about his past when Yuuji existed in the present. 

“I’m sorry.” Yuuji said meekly.

Toji sleepily opened one eye, “For what?” He asked.

“Does it hurt? The bite…” Yuuji whimpered, “I didn’t mean to.”

“Nah.” Toji pushed his thumb into it to prove that the initial pain had passed, “But you know…” A shift in position, and Toji moved to grip Yuuji’s chin. He squished his cheeks and spoke in a devilishly velvety tone, “I’ll be sure to do the same.”

#### **Author's Note** ####
There’s no greater fear than the hands of another when one has been through abuse. I often think about the information given to us about Toji; how Gege states that he often hopped from woman to woman and always spent money frivolously after abandoning his son. If Toji kept nothing, he was nothing, and like the others valued him to be nothing because he has no cursed energy, then he had no reason to live with pride.

If he held no value to himself, then he could forget about his self-loathing and live true to his feelings; nothing. I wanted to convey those feelings and the importance of Yuuji valuing him, and then being permitted to touch him freely. Despite the usual “Dominant” and “Submissive”, Toji is the one who allows him. It’s a very vulnerable position and one I’m sure would take a lot of him being around someone (if they haven't already gotten sick of him, or vice versa.)

I’ve been told I write pretty poetic sex and well, I want to make it significant. I want to tackle what he would feel like to encounter those difficult emotions. 

There’s no release date for chapter 4! I have planned for Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, with it ending at Chapter 5. Anything beyond chapter 5 will be considered “bonus scenarios” I have in my mind of this canon divergent verse.
