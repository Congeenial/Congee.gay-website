The sun dangled brightly above Yuuji’s head; with his arms raised high for a well-needed stretch, he then texts Megumi the immersive summary already plotted out as he was walking out of the movie theatre. A ‘read’ notice underneath his texts puts a smile on Yuuji’s face; the last thing he sees before he tucks his phone into his hoodie pocket are three little excited dots. 

He should get home with time to spare and wrap up the day with a nice home cooked meal. 

“What should I make?” He asked, drumming up a tune of what he’s in the mood for. Savoury?
Sweet? A little bit of both?

…Or maybe something explosive, as Yuuji dodges the assault from several pieces of concrete shooting past his face. 

What he witnesses is not a cursed spirit but it was in fact, a human who had collided in an excessively dramatic fashion into the movie theatre building. The glowing neon sign that was hanging lopsided flickers above the person’s head. Sparks from the electrical discharge became mini fireworks, as if the person needed a more grandiose entrance than they already had. 

“...Yo.” Yuuji said, perhaps too casually. He half-heartedly waved to the man. “You just missed the movie.”

He might’ve been lucky that the man found his untimely greeting too shocking to react to. Yuuji didn’t sense any cursed energy, so he wasn’t all that worried. 

“...Hi.” The man replied. He had sharp long black bangs with a muscular build, evident by the tightness of his…top? Shirt? Piece of cotton practically clinging to his skin?

The man had opened his mouth to say something else, though his words were interrupted by a loud ka-boom! of a cursed user across the other side of the city streets lunging at him.

Yuuji found it odd that he wasn’t caught off-guard.

“Give me a moment, kid.” The man grinned while holding a chain to block their attack, “You’re gonna be my witness.”

Mr. Shiu Kong rubbed his temples with taut fingers. Ignoring whatever excuse Toji explained, the cadaver produced from the fleshy purple worm was barely recognizable. The face especially, which the client emphasized to be left intact, looked like a rotten tomato. 

“I didn’t have a choice.” Toji reasoned with a shrug; an expression of concern is quickly put forth, though with little effort to retain it. 

“The client wanted him in *one piece*,” Mr. Shiu Kong explained, “Do you know what that means?”

“All the pieces are there,” Toji pointed to the torn off arm and leg. “Attach it back later. It’ll look like new.”

Mr. Shiu Kong did not look convinced. He groaned, threw his hands in the air, and had to think of a convoluted reason as to why the client’s goods were damaged. Toji pushed Yuuji in front of him. 

“This kid can attest.”

Yuuji nodded confidently. “He was almost dying!” He shouted. Yuuji explained in great detail, like he was watching one of those bonus scenes from the after credits. It was a battle one could have only known as “majestic” and “enigmatic” if they could have seen it with their own eyes. Toji’s smile widened to a smirk.

“See? It was a tough fight.” Toji exaggerated. Didn’t Mr. Shiu Kong see the sweat off his brow?

Instead, Mr. Shiu Kong *squinted* at Toji’s entire being unscathed. “I’m sure it was.” He replied, “You got the payment sent to you?”

Toji flipped open his burner phone. “Yeah.” 

Mr. Shiu Kong kicked both of them out of the meeting place shortly.

“Thanks for that, kid.” Toji said. He got the full amount with that excuse. Tucking his hands into the pockets of his loose sweatpants, Toji stared at the darkening sky. It was getting late and he needed to pick a place for dinner.

“Sure thing.” Yuuji replied with a smile, “But…are you sure you’re okay?” 

“I’m fine.” He tilted his head, “I’ll see you never.”

The likelihood of meeting another kid like this one was next to none, hence the farewell. Toji turned his heel and started walking in the other direction. 

“We can still catch a re-run.” Yuuji suggested, leaving Toji confused.

“Huh?” Toji turned around, “Kid, what are you talking about?”

“The movie that you crashed into.” 

“Ah…” Toji scratched the back of his neck. “I’ll pass. Thanks, thou-”

“Come on, I’ll pay for dinner after?” Yuuji sheepishly beamed, “There’s a cinema not far from here.”

Yuuji just really wanted a second person to go with to alleviate the embarrassment he felt about going alone. There’d usually be Nobara or Megumi to tag along, but both were busy tonight. The concession stand employee would surely recognize him as he was there the day before! 

“Well…” Toji tapped his feet. Who can say no to a free dinner? “Alright, as long as you’re paying.”

That night, Toji learned the kid’s name was “Yuuji Itadori”.

It’s the only man's name he’d end up remembering.

Toji awoke with a loud groan. He had dreamt of their first meeting once again.

His hand searched for his phone under the pillow. As soon as he read the time, he wanted to chuck it across the room; it wasn’t even close to what his alarm clock was set to! Toji lazily flips open his phone after some tossing and turning; he lays on his stomach with his face planted into the soft duvet sheets to hear a voicemail left earlier this morning.

‘I left breakfast in the fridge. Make sure to take out the trash today. I’ll be home around the usual time.’

A curt message, but Toji heard the warmth of their tone and got out of bed. 

Several trash bags dragged across the ground while Toji gathered the mess they made from their ‘extravagant weekend movie nights’; a fond smile lurked across his lips when he threw the koca-kola in. 

He’s not a movie connoisseur. The bigger and better entertainment was the person on his lap during it. 

He finished in record speed, beating his old timeーbecause the mundane becomes slightly more bearable when there's some form of competitionーand check his phone again.

‘Too late, hm.’ Toji thought. The trash collection on their block comes around early in the morning…and it was half past ten. No use griping about it. 

He’ll dump it in some poor sucker’s trashbin who lives in the next city over. 

Toji hopped out of the apartment window. A little less than five minutes and he’s already back, washing his hands and eating a delicious breakfast of eggs and sausage.
