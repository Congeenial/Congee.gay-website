The sun dangled brightly above Yuuji’s head; with his arms raised high for a well-needed stretch, he then texts Megumi the immersive summary already plotted out as he was walking out of the movie theatre. A ‘read’ notice underneath his texts puts a smile on Yuuji’s face; the last thing he sees before he tucks his phone into his hoodie pocket are three little excited dots. 

He should get home with time to spare and wrap up the day with a nice home cooked meal. 

“What should I make?” He asked, drumming up a tune of what he’s in the mood for. Savoury?
Sweet? A little bit of both?

…Or maybe something explosive, as Yuuji dodges the assault from several pieces of concrete shooting past his face. 

What he witnesses is not a cursed spirit but it was in fact, a human who had collided in an excessively dramatic fashion into the movie theatre building. The glowing neon sign that was hanging lopsided flickers above the person’s head. Sparks from the electrical discharge became mini fireworks, as if the person needed a more grandiose entrance than they already had. 

“...Yo.” Yuuji said, perhaps too casually. He half-heartedly waved to the man. “You just missed the movie.”

He might’ve been lucky that the man found his untimely greeting too shocking to react to. Yuuji didn’t sense any cursed energy, so he wasn’t all that worried. 

“...Hi.” The man replied. He had sharp long black bangs with a muscular build, evident by the tightness of his…top? Shirt? Piece of cotton practically clinging to his skin?

The man had opened his mouth to say something else, though his words were interrupted by a loud *ka-boom!* of a cursed user across the other side of the city streets lunging at him.

Yuuji found it odd that he wasn’t caught off-guard.

“Give me a moment, kid.” The man grinned while holding a chain to block their attack, “You’re gonna be my witness.”
___
Mr. Shiu Kong rubbed his temples with taut fingers. Ignoring whatever excuse Toji explained, the cadaver produced from the fleshy purple worm was barely recognizable. The face especially, which the client emphasized to be left intact, looked like a rotten tomato. 

“I didn’t have a choice.” Toji reasoned with a shrug; an expression of concern is quickly put forth, though with little effort to retain it. 

“The client wanted him in *one piece*,” Mr. Shiu Kong explained, “Do you know what that means?”

“All the pieces are there,” Toji pointed to the torn off arm and leg. “Attach it back later. It’ll look like new.”

Mr. Shiu Kong did not look convinced. He groaned, threw his hands in the air, and had to think of a convoluted reason as to why the client’s goods were damaged. Toji pushed Yuuji in front of him. 

“This kid can attest.”

Yuuji nodded confidently. “He was almost dying!” He shouted. Yuuji explained in great detail, like he was watching one of those bonus scenes from the after credits. It was a battle one could have only known as “majestic” and “enigmatic” if they could have seen it with their own eyes. Toji’s smile widened to a smirk.

“See? It was a tough fight.” Toji exaggerated. Didn’t Mr. Shiu Kong see the sweat off his brow?

Instead, Mr. Shiu Kong *squinted* at Toji’s entire being unscathed. “I’m sure it was.” He replied, “You got the payment sent to you?”

Toji flipped open his burner phone. “Yeah.” 

Mr. Shiu Kong kicked both of them out of the meeting place shortly. 
___
“Thanks for that, kid.” Toji said. He got the full amount with that excuse. Tucking his hands into the pockets of his loose sweatpants, Toji stared at the darkening sky. It was getting late and he needed to pick a place for dinner.

“Sure thing.” Yuuji replied with a smile, “But…are you sure you’re okay?” 

“I’m fine.” He tilted his head, “I’ll see you never.”

The likelihood of meeting another kid like this one was next to none, hence the farewell. Toji turned his heel and started walking in the other direction. 

“We can still catch a re-run.” Yuuji suggested, leaving Toji confused.

“Huh?” Toji turned around, “Kid, what are you talking about?”

“The movie that you crashed into.” 

“Ah…” Toji scratched the back of his neck. “I’ll pass. Thanks, thou-”

“Come on, I’ll pay for dinner after?” Yuuji sheepishly beamed, “There’s a cinema not far from here.”

Yuuji just really wanted a second person to go with to alleviate the embarrassment he felt about going alone. There’d usually be Nobara or Megumi to tag along, but both were busy tonight. The concession stand employee would surely recognize him as he was there the day before! 

“Well…” Toji tapped his feet. Who can say no to a free dinner? “Alright, as long as *you’re paying*.”

That night, Toji learned the kid’s name was “Yuuji Itadori”.

It’s the only man's name he’d end up remembering.
___
Toji awoke with a loud groan. He had dreamt of their first meeting once again.

His hand searched for his phone under the pillow. As soon as he read the time, he wanted to chuck it across the room; it wasn’t even close to what his alarm clock was set to! Toji lazily flips open his phone after some tossing and turning; he lays on his stomach with his face planted into the soft duvet sheets to hear a voicemail left earlier this morning.

‘*I left breakfast in the fridge. Make sure to take out the trash today. I’ll be home around the usual time.*’

A curt message, but Toji heard the warmth of their tone and got out of bed. 

Several trash bags dragged across the ground while Toji gathered the mess they made from their ‘extravagant weekend movie nights’; a fond smile lurked across his lips when he threw the koca-kola in. 

He’s not a movie connoisseur. The bigger and better entertainment was the person on his lap during it. 

He finished in record speed, beating his old timeーbecause the mundane becomes slightly more bearable when there's some form of competitionーand check his phone again.

‘*Too late, hm.*’ Toji thought. The trash collection on their block comes around early in the morning…and it was half past ten. No use griping about it. 

He’ll dump it in some poor sucker’s trashbin who lives in the next city over. 

Toji hopped out of the apartment window. A little less than five minutes and he’s already back, washing his hands and eating a delicious breakfast of eggs and sausage.
___
In the early afternoon, Toji stopped by to play the pachinko machines. The erratic, yet enticing noises of ball bearings falling and others around him equally looking to score big deafened Mr. Shiu Kong’s steps. 

He is greeted by a tap on the shoulder when several shouts of his name go unnoticed. Toji craned his head backwards and raised an eyebrow.

“What?” Toji frowned, “How did you even find me?”

“It’s not exactly *hard* to figure out your hobby.” Mr. Shiu Kong smirked; Toji’s eyebrows furrowed alongside a tut on his lower lip. “I thought racing was your thing.”

“This place is a five minute walk.” Toji yawned, “It’s easier, you know? Ever since he introduced me to these.” 

A ball bearing suddenly landed into the start chakka and Toji’s eyes went wide like his life flashed before his eyes. He held his breath while the LCD screen rolled the slot machine; the first two matches had Toji on the edge of his painfully small seat. 

And the third? *What about the third?!*

A jingle started blaring like police sirens and Mr. Shiu Kong covered his ears; Toji slinked back into the seat and clutched his chest. 

Thank god. No, thank the kid’s luck rubbing off on him.

It was a jackpot. 

“Anyway, did you need something?” Toji asked casually, waving his hand for one of the staff to assist him. 

“Not here.” Mr. Shiu Kong pointed to the entrance. “I can’t hear a damn thing.”
___
Toji maintained his uncaring countenance upon Mr. Shiu Kong showing him a photo of what looks like another Jujutsu sorcerer. A young woman with a bounty of ten million yen who knew reversed cursed technique. 

“You interested?” Mr. Shiu Kong asked. Toji watched him step on his smoked cigarette. 

Ten million yen is a lot of money. That’s money he could use to gamble and she sounded easy enough.

“No thanks.” He lamented the loss, but he’ll live. Best not to chance his winnings today. 

“I thought you’d be gung ho.” 

“Life’s gotten busy since I’ve met the kid.” 

Mr. Shiu Kong snickered. “He hasn’t kicked you out yet?”

“It’s free housing.” Toji held up a credit card. “Plus, how can I pass this up?”

“You’re disgusting.” Mr. Shiu Kong handed him a cigarette. “There’s gonna be a bounty on his head when they know you’re with him.” 

“Hah.” Toji snatched Mr. Shiu Kong’s lighter and lit the cigarette himself. He blew out a puff of smoke. The taste of nicotine was revolting on his sensitive tongue. “They can certainly try.”

Nothing wrong with protecting what he deems to be his entire world, right? 
___
When the evening sun lowered to rest its scorching presence, Toji was already at home to hide away from the heatwaves. He idled away his hours by watching the television, cooking, and a nap, shortly awoken by a ring on his flip phone.

The caller ID was a nickname only Toji would know, and he’s not inclined to share it with the rest of the world.

“I’m sorry!” were the first words uttered from them. Toji frowned, listening to a panicked explanation of an unexpected situation that had delayed the trains. 

 “Uh huh.” He leaned further into the couch and put up one of his legs. “Need me to come get you?”

His fingers on the phone twitched.

“I’ll be okay.” The voice replied sincerely, “Did you make dinner? I can get take out.”

“I made ramen.”

Meaning he used instant noodles and broth, cut up some green onions, and bought some pre-sliced pork belly.

The person on the other side laughs, hearing how confident Toji sounded. “I got it.” They said, “I’m getting a ride home. I’ll see you soon.”

“See you.” 
___
Toji doesn’t move from the couch right away when he hears that unique *click!* of a successful keypad input. It was too much effort, and so they found their way to him instead. His chin is lifted to steal his attention away from a show he was barely paying attention to.

Their lips touch ever so tenderly.

He tilted his head and returned the kiss fondly. There’s the taste of…honey? Something sweet like the soda they had the night before.

“I’m home.”

Toji’s shoulders, which had unconsciously tightened for misfortune, unwound their knots. There’s been a gnaw slinking forth at the precipice of his mind, presuming the worst and making a habit of being relieved when his concerns are disproven by their presence wholly intact.

It's persisted since he’s lived here.

“Welcome home, Yuuji.” He replied, amused at the light flush on Yuuji’s cheek. “Water’s heated up for you, babygirl.”

Yuuji beamed. “Five minutes, and I’ll be right out for dinner!”

He scudded to the bathing room, as if he's being blown by a powerful wind. Just before he stepped into the tub, Yuuji peeked his head out while Toji was setting the utensils down.

“I have tomorrow off.” Yuuji muttered. Toji knew where this was heading.

“Is that so?” Toji nonchalantly replied. He barely looked up, adjusting the angle of the chopsticks to be parallel. Yuuji always complimented him when he set them correctly.

Yuuji nodded. “You should take a bath too.”

Toji chuckled. “Are you asking me to, *princess*?”

Yuuji’s eyes flickered. There is a change between his usual perky and playful demeanor to something more intimidating. It lasts for a second, just enough for Toji to notice and widen his mirthful grin.

“I’m telling you to.”

Yuuji slammed the door shut before he could hear Toji’s response. He slapped both of his cheeks several times, wondering if it had made Toji mad to hear that.

“He’s too good at teasing me…” Yuuji sighed, “Control yourself, Yuuji!”

Not like he’ll listen to his own advice once they’re in bed.
___
Dinner was as extravagant as it could be by Toji’s standards. Although it wasn’t the same tier as the ramen Yuuji made, Yuuji still ate it, broth and all. At the table, Toji digested the entirety of Yuuji’s day, rolling his eyes whenever the subject of that one arrogant bastard came up and remaining quiet at the mention of his son. 

They head to bed soon after Toji’s shower.

The intended use for a bed was usually to sleep after a productive day for the both of them, but Yuuji straddled Toji’s lap instead. Toji leaned back into the bedframe, hands resting on Yuuji’s waist. Their lips mingled first, then their tongues followed suit. 

Toji’s cradled hold increased their pressure; pushing past the inviting texture of Yuuji’s hoodie, he ladled his desires by mere touch. 

Yuuji breaks the kiss, leaving the last one on Toji’s cheek. “Do you feel okay today?” He asked with a warm smile. 

“Let’s find out.” Toji indulged; he grabbed Yuuji’s wrist and raised it to the back of his head. 

Pinning Yuuji to the bed, an audible pleasure gasp erupted from Yuuji. Heat transfers from mouth to his groin when they kiss again, melting into Toji’s hand upon another demanding one on his crotch. His pants came off easily and revealed an eager erection. Yuuji tilted his head with a laidback expression.

*So cute*, Yuuji thought. It was unwonted Toji would want to take the reins; he handed the baton to Yuuji almost daily. It wasn’t that Toji couldn’t. Toji explained it in very simple layman terms:
##
> “*I’m lazy.*”
##
While Yuuji found that initially off putting, Toji has never refused him when he wanted it, so it has to count for something? For Toji to take the lead tonight…

*He probably won at pachinko.*

Yuuji won’t ask about it, craning his neck back with a sensuous moan when something rough sinks to his skin. The grooves of Toji’s teeth indented and flayed Yuuji with scarlet marks that would last for several days. His ears ring to the pulsating sensation of Toji’s claim; Yuuji sucked in a deep breath. He held it with a stained cry, but his eyes were closed in wondrous fondness for the pain it left.

Though, Yuuji is anything but *prey*.

With a gentle tap on Toji’s shoulder, Yuuji catches his attention enough to slide his fingers into the spaces of Toji’s. He leaned forward, first letting their cheeks touch; a momentary reprieve from the lust. 

“Toji…don’t keep me waiting.” Yuuji exhaled, “Your boner is pushing against mine.”

“...Brat.” Toji replied. He slid off his own sweatpants.

Their boxers graze atop one another’s, Yuuji arching into the fabric andーcupping Toji’s face. 

Maybe Toji’s never seen his own dark lines under his eyelids; they looked fatigued and yet restless, yearning but evermore numb. It contrasts the lightest pigments of his face that’s shifted to a peach pink. 

It doesn’t take long for Toji to jerk his head away and remove their boxers next. He liberally lubricates their members and quickly begins rubbing his cock right on top of Yuuji’s.

Andーgod, if Yuuji had a god he could pray to, would be on his knees in thanks. Seeing Toji’s eyes shut tight at the stimulation, edging towards the husky growls to moans has Yuuji mirroring Toji’s actions.

The tip of Yuuji’s cock brushes to Toji’s, and Yuuji lifts up his own hoodie to pull at his nipples. 

“Toji…” Yuuji whispered in absorbing tenderness, “Look at me.”

Toji does, albeit with a half-lidded gaze.

Yuuji pinches his pink bud and groans Toji’s name. He lets the saliva pool in his mouth so it could drool at the corner of his lips, constantly rubbing the side of his dick to Toji’s girthy cock. He wants Toji to watch. 

He wants him to see everything.

Toji grunts quietly to echo Yuuji’s wanton mewls, immured by the noises.

Pretending to be turned on by whatever woman he was fucking before he got associated with the kid was easy; stick in his dick inside and let hormones do the rest. 

Not this one.

An authentic and exhilarating smile glued to his mouth, devoid of any trickery, makes Toji wish he had almost known this kid sooner. He’s never come so fast in his life as the semen spurted onto Yuuji’s stomach and Yuuji similarly gushed his seed onto Toji’s dick and lower stomach.

They breathe quietly, satisfied by that alone. 

Toji takes another shower with Yuuji and this time with the intention to sleep, hold him close in bed. 

His eyes flicker towards the table clock on the nightdesk. 

10:30P.M. The earliest he’s slept in the past few months.

“You asleep, kid?” Toji asked. 

No response.

Yuuji has already phased into another dimension of dreams, it seems.

A memory flashed before his eyes of a similar night taking place inside of a love hotel. She moaned his name and screamed effortlessly. She paid him in full and then some more from her purse of bottomless cash and Toji was happy he could have more money for tomorrow’s horse race. 

Of course, there was never any real affection. Her undulating body, breathing softly underneath his touches never had any form of love. The exchange was treated like he was a commodity, much like how the Zen’in treated him. But that was okay, if that’s how they saw him. It would fit the value of his worth. He is about as significant as the trash he threw out this morning. 

Toji squeezed Yuuji a little tighter. 

*Not him. He keeps inviting him back and Toji doesn’t know why.*

Yuuji suddenly shifted and turned around, not asleep after all; he murmured, “Stay a little longer,” knowing Toji would depart and leave the bed cold. He doesn’t know where he goes, but at least he’ll come back a little later.

Toji can only express a helpless smile. He hasn’t yet strayed from what he’s used to. 

It’s times like this that Yuuji wishes he could tie a collar around Toji’s neck and leash him to the bed.
