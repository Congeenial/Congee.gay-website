### Currently Working On: ###
- Vampire AU ( Toji + Yuuji )
- Bodyguard AU ( Toji + Gojou, Non-romantic )
- Petplay ( Toji + Yuuji, Fanfic )

### You can: ###
- Use my art as icons as long as you credit my Twit/X acc
- DM me to repost to different website
- Use my fanart as inspiration for fanfiction if you atleast ask beforehand.
 
### You cannot: ###
- use my fanart for AI training or for NFTs
- trace or copy my work. 
- request me to draw anything. (If requests are open because i post it, feel free)
- Ask for commission. I open them when I feel like it
 
You will generally find me drawing SFW here with very few NSFW pieces. I prefer to write NSFW rather than draw it. Fics will be uploaded to ao3 after a few days from my blog posts.
I like fluff, a lot of it, and so I tend to stray away from darker content like dub-con and non-con (I'm fine with reading it). Angst between characters however, is one of my favorites.

Toji Fushiguro is my favorite character. I like him with Gojou or Yuuji, but not both at the same time. Interested in exploring relationships between them but it's not always romantic.
 
**my NOTPs:**
- Toji with any family member excluding his wife. I don't like him with Naoya, Maki, his brother, etc. and esp. Megumi romantically. Megumi is esp. a landmine.
- Gojou and Geto romantically. I only like them platonic, as best friends.

I am NOT a fixed shipper. I don't tag my ship art with the intention of it being unable to be searched via twitter. If I ever use a ship name, its either out of abbreviation due to twit character limits, or I'm talking about them switching. 
 
*Do not ask me to use ship names. I won't. I don't care if you do, but it's something personal to me to avoid them like a plague. If this bothers you, avoid following me/block me/etc.*

*In some cases, I will use Sub top!Toji/Dom bottom!Yuuji to indicate a specific dynamic I have for them. That AU has a fixed top/bottom due to my interpretation, but other AUs (such as my vampire or dragon AU) are left to viewer interpretation whether they are fixed or switch.

**Do you ship Toji with anyone else?**
Too many people ask so I'm putting it alongside what's already written on my profile: I don't. I'm not interested romantically in Toji being shipped with anyone else aside from what's already listed on my profile. I don't make exceptions. 

**you're free to interpret my art however you like in the end. Just because I don't use shipnames doesn't mean you can't enjoy them how you want. Tojita, itatoji, tojitatoji, no romance, etc. I don't care.**
 
 My landmines(squicks) for content:
- NTR ( cheating )
- BDSM used as a means to sexually abuse someone
- Mpreg and any other AU that has secondary sex characteristics to be used as top/bottom tropes. This includes Dom/Sub verse.
- Lolicon/Shotacon. (SFW is okay)

**Just cause I have squicks doesn't mean you can't interact with me. Your tastes, my tastes, does not equal personality. I love getting to know people, but I'm shy myself, so please feel free to DM if you have any questions or comments.**
