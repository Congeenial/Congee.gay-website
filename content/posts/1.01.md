### Currently Working On: ###
- Vampire AU ( Toji + Yuuji )
- Bodyguard AU ( Toji + Gojou, Non-romantic )
- Petplay ( Toji + Yuuji, Fanfic )

### You can: ###
- Use my art as icons as long as you credit my Twit/X acc
- DM me to repost to different website
- Use my fanart as inspiration for fanfiction if you atleast ask beforehand.
 
### You cannot: ###
- use my fanart for AI training or for NFTs
- trace or copy my work. 
- request me to draw anything. (If requests are open because i post it, feel free)
- Ask for commission. I open them when I feel like it
 
You will generally find me drawing SFW here with very few NSFW pieces. I prefer to write NSFW rather than draw it. Fics will be uploaded to ao3 after a few days from my blog posts.
 
**my NOTPs:**
- Toji and Megumi romantically in any caliber even if SFW. ( This is my biggest landmine, so please be wary that mentions of it will make me extremely uncomfortable. )
- Toji And Naoya.
- Gojou and Geto romantically. I only like them platonic, as best friends. 
- Yuuji and Todo 
 
**I'm okay with most Yuuji and Toji ships, but will only talk about Toji/Yuuji or Toji/Gojou on my timeline.**
 
I am NOT a fixed shipper. I don't tag my ship art with the intention of it being unable to be searched via twitter. If I ever use a ship name, its either out of abbreviation due to twit character limits, or I'm talking about them switching. 
 
*In regards to this, I understand the concept of tagging a shipname is to properly tag two characters, but it also has the implications of who tops or bottoms. I don't follow this, never will, and I dislike any implications of it, ESPECIALLY when I feel like I'm required to tag it for a SFW piece depicting no top/bottom dynamic. Therefore, I omit all shipnames from my art/writing posts. I will ONLY use X+Y to indicate two characters together. If that bothers you, I suggest you avoid following me.*
 
**you're free to interpret my art however you like. Just because I don't use shipnames doesn't mean you can't enjoy them how you want. Tojita, itatoji, tojitatoji, no romance, etc. I don't care.**
 
 
My landmines(squicks) for content:
- NTR ( cheating )
- BDSM used as a means to sexually abuse someone
- Mpreg, A/B/O, and any other AU that has secondary sex characteristics to be used as top/bottom tropes. 
- Lolicon/Shotacon.
**Just cause I have squicks doesn't mean you can't interact with me. Your tastes, my tastes, does not equal preferences. I love getting to know people, but I'm shy myself, so please feel free to DM if you have any questions or comments.**
