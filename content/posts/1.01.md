### Currently Working On: ###
- Vampire AU ( Toji + Yuuji )
- Bodyguard AU ( Toji + Gojou, Non-romantic )
- Petplay ( Toji + Yuuji, Fanfic )

### You can: ###
- Use my art as icons as long as you credit my Twit/X acc
- DM me to repost to different website
- Use my fanart as inspiration for fanfiction if you atleast ask beforehand.
 
You will generally find me drawing SFW here with very few NSFW pieces. I like fluff, a lot of it, and so I tend to stray away from darker content like dub-con and non-con (I'm fine with reading it). Angst between characters however, is one of my favorites.

Toji Fushiguro is my favorite character. I like him with Gojou or Yuuji, but not both at the same time. Interested in exploring relationships between them but it's not always romantic.
I am NOT a fixed shipper. I don't tag my ship art with the intention of it being unable to be searched via twitter.

*In some cases, I will use Sub top!Toji/Dom bottom!Yuuji to indicate a specific dynamic I have for them. That AU has a fixed top/bottom due to my interpretation, but other AUs (such as my vampire or dragon AU) are left to viewer interpretation whether they are fixed or switch.

My preference is Yuuji dominant, Gojou submissive, Toji submissive. Top/bottom doesn't matter to me.
Toji being shipped with Yuuji or Gojou is absolutely **FIXED.** I do not make exceptions, and every other ship is a landmine. 
I like Yuuji with other characters like Sukuna and Gojou. I like Gojou with several characters such as Sukuna and Ieiri. 

*I generally dislike content where Toji is getting abused or is the abuser, typical "daddy dilf w/o any trauma Tojii", and so I won't interact with it. If the mute button doesn't work and tweets about him come on my timeline in such a situation, I will block. 


**I am still dead dove, just not with Toji.**
 
**my NOTPs:**
- Toji with any family member excluding his wife. I don't like him with Naoya, Maki, his brother, etc. and esp. Megumi romantically.
- Gojou and Geto romantically. I only like them platonic, as best friends.
- Megmui + Yuuji where Megumi is in love with Yuuji but Yuuji is in love with Toji instead. Just no.
- Toji + Shiu. 
- Megumi + Sukuna.

**My landmines(squicks) for content:**
- NTR ( cheating )
- BDSM used as a means to sexually abuse someone
- Mpreg and any other AU that has secondary sex characteristics to be used as stereotypical top/bottom tropes. This includes Dom/Sub verse.
- Lolicon/Shotacon. (SFW is okay)
- Genderbending for NSFW only
**Just cause I have squicks doesn't mean you can't interact with me. Your tastes, my tastes, does not equal personality. I love getting to know people, but I'm shy myself, so please feel free to DM if you have any questions or comments.**

**you're free to interpret my art however you like in the end. Just because I don't use shipnames doesn't mean you can't enjoy them how you want. Tojita, itatoji, tojitatoji, no romance, etc. I don't care.**
